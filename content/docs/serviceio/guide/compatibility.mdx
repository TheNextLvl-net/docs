ServiceIO includes an experimental compatibility mode designed to resolve issues with plugins that don't properly recognize ServiceIO as a Vault provider.
This mode modifies how ServiceIO is loaded by the server making it appear like the original Vault plugin.

<Callout type="warning" title="Experimental Feature">
  Compatibility mode is experimental and may not work with all plugins.  
  It could potentially cause issues with other plugins.  
  Use this mode only as a last resort and report any problems to our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/service-io/issues/new?template=incompatible_plugin.yml).
</Callout>

## When to Use Compatibility Mode

Enable compatibility mode if you encounter:

### Common Compatibility Issues

- **Plugin Not Detecting Vault**: A plugin reports, e.g. "Vault not found"
- **Service Registration Problems**: Plugins that directly check for specific Vault implementation classes
- **Custom Vault Hooks**: Plugins that use non-standard methods to access Vault services

### How to Enable Compatibility Mode

To enable compatibility mode, start your server with the `COMPATIBILITY_MODE` environment variable set to `true`.

For example, in a Linux environment, you can start your server with:

```bash
export COMPATIBILITY_MODE=true
java -jar server.jar --nogui
```

Or if your setup doesnt allow exporting environment variables, you can use:

```bash
COMPATIBILITY_MODE=true java -jar server.jar --nogui
```

In docker (compose) you can set the environment variable like this:

```yaml
services:
  your_service:
    image: your_image
    environment:
      - COMPATIBILITY_MODE=true
    ...
```
