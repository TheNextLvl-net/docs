<Callout title="Requirements">
  ServiceIO v2.3.1+ and [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI) are required for placeholder support.
</Callout>

ServiceIO provides PlaceholderAPI integration, allowing you to use ServiceIO data in other plugins that support placeholders.

## Placeholder Format

All ServiceIO placeholders follow the format:
```
%serviceio_<placeholder>%
```

## Available Placeholders

### Player Information
- `%serviceio_prefix%` - Player's prefix from the permission service
- `%serviceio_suffix%` - Player's suffix from the permission service  
- `%serviceio_displayname%` - Player's display name

### Economy (Bank)
- `%serviceio_bank%` - Alias for `bank_balance`
- `%serviceio_bank_balance%` - Player's current balance (raw number)
- `%serviceio_bank_balance_formatted%` - Player's current balance (formatted with currency)

<Callout title="Bank Placeholders">
  Bank placeholders require an economy service provider to be installed and configured with ServiceIO.
</Callout>

### Permission Groups
- `%serviceio_group%` - Player's primary permission group
- `%serviceio_groups%` - All of player's permission groups (comma-separated)

### Additional Placeholders

More placeholders may be available depending on your installed service providers and ServiceIO configuration. The complete list depends on:
- Installed economy plugins
- Permission plugins 
- Other service providers registered with ServiceIO

## Usage Examples

### In Chat Formats
```yaml
# Example chat format using ServiceIO placeholders
format: "%serviceio_prefix%%player_name%%serviceio_suffix%: %message%"
```

### In Scoreboards
```yaml
# Example scoreboard using economy data
title: "Server Info"
lines:
  - "Balance: %serviceio_bank_balance_formatted%"
  - "Rank: %serviceio_group%"
```

### In MOTD or Other Text
```yaml
# Welcome message with player data
welcome-message: "Welcome %serviceio_displayname%! Your balance: %serviceio_bank_balance_formatted%"
```

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="error" title="Placeholder Not Working?">
  Ensure that:
  1. ServiceIO v2.3.1+ is installed
  2. PlaceholderAPI is installed and enabled
  3. The relevant service provider (economy, permissions) is installed and working
  4. ServiceIO has successfully detected and registered the service provider
</Callout>

If a placeholder returns empty or default values, check your ServiceIO configuration and ensure the appropriate service providers are properly installed and configured.
