## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="error" title="Placeholder Not Working?">
  Ensure that:
  1. ServiceIO v2.3.0+ is installed
  2. PlaceholderAPI is installed and enabled
  3. The relevant service provider (economy, permissions...) is installed and working
  4. ServiceIO has successfully detected and registered the service provider
  5. There is no typo in the placeholder and it is properly used `%serviceio_<PLACEHOLDER>%`
</Callout>

If a placeholder shows the literal placeholder text instead of the expected value, check your ServiceIO configuration and ensure the appropriate service providers are properly installed and configured.
