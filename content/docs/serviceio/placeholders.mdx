## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="error" title="Placeholder Not Working?">
  Ensure that:
  1. ServiceIO v2.3.1+ is installed
  2. PlaceholderAPI is installed and enabled
  3. The relevant service provider (economy, permissions) is installed and working
  4. ServiceIO has successfully detected and registered the service provider
</Callout>

If a placeholder returns empty or default values, check your ServiceIO configuration and ensure the appropriate service providers are properly installed and configured.
