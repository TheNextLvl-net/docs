import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion"

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion 
    title="Why should I use ServiceIO?"
    id="why-serviceio"
  >
    ServiceIO not only provides the Vault and VaultUnlocked API, but also provides a lot of additional features.<br/>
    It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Vault, but with more features and a nicer API.

    From a user perspective, ServiceIO offers the ability to convert between any given service providers.<br/>
    This, for example, allows you to switch out your Permissions, NPC or Holograms plugin effortlessly.<br/>
    Vault only offers this for Economy services, while ServiceIO offers this for all providers.

    In addition to the standard Vault interfaces, ServiceIO provides a common **NPC** and **Hologram API**,<br/>
    which allows developers to support multiple plugins without having to implement the same functionality multiple times.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="How does ServiceIO work?"
    id="links"
  >
    ServiceIO provides both the Vault and VaultUnlocked API and creates a so called _Wrapper_ around those APIs.  
    The wrapper _wraps_ our controller based API to a Vault interface, which is then used by other plugins.  
    The same concept applies the other way around by wrapping the Vault interface to our controller based API.  
    This allows users of the ServiceIO API to use the Vault API without having to implement it themselves, and again, the other way around.

  <Accordion 
    title="Will ServiceIO ever support older Minecraft versions?"
    id="old-versions"
  >
    No, we do not aim to support any previous version of the game.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Which server software does ServiceIO support?"
    id="server-software"
  >
    The only officially supported server software are [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper)
    and [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia)
    although forks like [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) or [Pufferfish](https://pufferfish.host/downloads)
    most likely work as well.
    
    <Callout type="error" title="Note">
      Support will not be provided for non-paper based server software or unknown, arbitrary forks.   
      Non-paper based server software will probably never be supported.   
      Hybrids that try to support both mods and plugins are completely unsupported and will most likely not work.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Which version of ServiceIO should I choose?"
    id="version"
  >
    <Callout title="Important">
      You will only get support for the latest version of ServiceIO.   
      If you encounter any issues while running an older build, you will not receive any support.
    </Callout>

    If you are **not** running the **latest** version of Paper, visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/MNPyHOe7/versions)
    and look for the latest version supporting your server version.

    _For any version not listed on Modrinth, see [#old-versions](#old-versions)._

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="One of my plugins doesn't recognize ServiceIO as Vault?"
    id="plugin-not-recognized"
  >
    If one of your plugins doesn't recognize ServiceIO as a Vault provider, you can try to enable the **experimental** compatibility mode.
    <Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
      This mode is experimental and may not work with all plugins and could in return also cause issues with other plugins.  
      It is recommended to only use this mode as a last resort, and to report the incompatible plugin to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/service-io/issues/new?template=incompatible_plugin.yml).
    </Callout>

    To enable the compatibility mode, set the environment variable `COMPATIBILITY_MODE=true`
