ServiceIO is a powerful, modern replacement for Vault that provides a comprehensive service layer for Minecraft servers.
It offers the traditional Vault API and the VaultUnlocked API while extending functionality far beyond what Vault provides.

**100% Vault and VaultUnlocked compatibility**, just remove the Vault plugin and drop in ServiceIO.

## What is ServiceIO?

ServiceIO is designed as a drop-in replacement for Vault, but with significantly more features and a cleaner, more modern API.
While Vault focuses primarily on economy services, ServiceIO provides unified interfaces for:

- **Economy Services** - Balance management, transactions, and banking  
- **Permission Services** - Groups and permissions  
- **NPC Services** - NPC management  
- **Hologram Services** - Unified hologram API  
- **Chat Services** - Chat formatting and prefixes/suffixes  
- **Service Conversion** - Convert data between different service providers

## Key Features

### Service Provider Flexibility

ServiceIO allows you to switch between different service providers (like economy or permission plugins) without losing your data.
The built-in conversion system lets you migrate from one plugin to another seamlessly.
While Vault offers the same functionality for economy services, ServiceIO makes it possible for all services.
This allows you to switch from, lets say, GroupManager to LuckPerms in a breeze, or from Citizens to FancyNPCs.

## How does ServiceIO Work?

ServiceIO uses a wrapper-based architecture that creates a bridge between different service APIs:

```mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph AA [Plugins]
A[Vault plugin];
B[ServiceIO plugin];
C[VaultUnlocked plugin];
end
subgraph BB [Wrapped Services]
E[Vault];
F[ServiceIO];
G[VaultUnlocked];
end
Z[ServiceIO];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> E;
Z --> F;
Z --> G;
```

This design allows:
- **Multi-directional Compatibility** - Vault plugins work with modern services and vice versa
- **Service Abstraction** - Switch providers without changing your plugins
