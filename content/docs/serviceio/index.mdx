ServiceIO is a powerful, modern replacement for Vault that provides a comprehensive service layer for Minecraft servers. It offers both the traditional Vault API and the newer VaultUnlocked API while extending functionality far beyond what Vault provides.

## What is ServiceIO?

ServiceIO is designed as a drop-in replacement for Vault, but with significantly more features and a cleaner, more modern API. While Vault focuses primarily on economy services, ServiceIO provides a unified interface for:

- **Economy Services** - Balance management, transactions, and banking
- **Permission Services** - Groups, permissions, and prefixes/suffixes  
- **NPC Services** - Cross-plugin NPC management
- **Hologram Services** - Unified hologram API
- **Chat Services** - Chat formatting and messaging
- **Service Conversion** - Convert data between different service providers

## Key Features

</Callout>

### First Steps

After installation, use these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check ServiceIO status
/service info

# List all detected service providers
/service list

# View available conversion options
/service convert
```

### Configuration

ServiceIO works out-of-the-box with minimal configuration. However, you can customize behavior through:

- **Environment Variables** - For compatibility modes and debugging
- **Service Provider Configs** - Configure individual service providers
- **Permission Setup** - Grant appropriate permissions to users

## Architecture

ServiceIO uses a wrapper-based architecture that creates a bridge between different service APIs:

```
Your Plugin ‚Üî Vault API ‚Üî ServiceIO ‚Üî Service Provider (LuckPerms, Essentials, etc.)
```

This design allows:
- **Bidirectional Compatibility** - Vault plugins work with modern services and vice versa
- **Service Abstraction** - Switch providers without changing your plugins
