## Configuration

### Enabling Social Features

In your main configuration file, you can control which features are available:

```json
{
  "social": {
    "add-link-commands": true,
    "add-server-links": true,
    "announcements": true,
    "community": true,
    "feedback": false,
    "forum": true,
    "guidelines": true,
    "issues": false,
    "news": true,
    "status": false,
    "support": true,
    "website": true,
    "discord": true,
    "reddit": false,
    "teamspeak": false,
    "twitch": false,
    "x": true,
    "youtube": true
  }
}
```

### Setting Up Links

Configure your actual URLs in the links section:

```json
{
  "links": {
    "announcements": "https://yourserver.com/announcements",
    "community": "https://yourserver.com/community", 
    "feedback": "https://forms.yourserver.com/feedback",
    "forum": "https://forum.yourserver.com",
    "guidelines": "https://yourserver.com/rules",
    "issues": "https://github.com/yourserver/issues",
    "news": "https://yourserver.com/news",
    "status": "https://status.yourserver.com",
    "support": "https://support.yourserver.com",
    "website": "https://yourserver.com",
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/yourinvite",
    "reddit": "https://reddit.com/r/yourserver",
    "teamspeak": "ts3server://ts.yourserver.com:9987",
    "twitch": "https://twitch.tv/yourchannel",
    "x": "https://x.com/yourhandle",
    "youtube": "https://youtube.com/c/yourchannel"
  }
}
```

## Server Links Tab Integration

When `add-server-links` is enabled, Tweaks automatically integrates with Minecraft's Server Links feature, making your community links easily accessible directly from the Minecraft client.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Registration**: Enabled links are automatically registered with the Minecraft client
2. **Client Integration**: Players can access links through the server list or in-game menus
3. **Seamless Experience**: No need for players to remember commands or URLs
