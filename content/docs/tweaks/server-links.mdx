# Server Links

Tweaks provides powerful social integration features that help connect your Minecraft server with your broader community presence. This includes both in-game commands and integration with Minecraft's Server Links feature.

## Overview

The server links system allows you to:

- **Provide quick access** to your community platforms via in-game commands
- **Integrate with Minecraft's Server Links tab** for easy access from the client
- **Customize which platforms** are available to your players
- **Maintain consistent branding** across your server ecosystem

## Configuration

### Enabling Social Features

In your main configuration file, you can control which features are available:

```json
{
  "social": {
    "add-link-commands": true,
    "add-server-links": true,
    "announcements": true,
    "community": true,
    "feedback": false,
    "forum": true,
    "guidelines": true,
    "issues": false,
    "news": true,
    "status": false,
    "support": true,
    "website": true,
    "discord": true,
    "reddit": false,
    "teamspeak": false,
    "twitch": false,
    "x": true,
    "youtube": true
  }
}
```

### Setting Up Links

Configure your actual URLs in the links section:

```json
{
  "links": {
    "announcements": "https://yourserver.com/announcements",
    "community": "https://yourserver.com/community", 
    "feedback": "https://forms.yourserver.com/feedback",
    "forum": "https://forum.yourserver.com",
    "guidelines": "https://yourserver.com/rules",
    "issues": "https://github.com/yourserver/issues",
    "news": "https://yourserver.com/news",
    "status": "https://status.yourserver.com",
    "support": "https://support.yourserver.com",
    "website": "https://yourserver.com",
    "discord": "https://discord.gg/yourinvite",
    "reddit": "https://reddit.com/r/yourserver",
    "teamspeak": "ts3server://ts.yourserver.com:9987",
    "twitch": "https://twitch.tv/yourchannel",
    "x": "https://x.com/yourhandle",
    "youtube": "https://youtube.com/c/yourchannel"
  }
}
```

## Server Links Tab Integration

When `add-server-links` is enabled, Tweaks automatically integrates with Minecraft's Server Links feature, making your community links easily accessible directly from the Minecraft client.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Registration**: Enabled links are automatically registered with the Minecraft client
2. **Client Integration**: Players can access links through the server list or in-game menus
3. **Seamless Experience**: No need for players to remember commands or URLs

### Supported Link Types

Minecraft's Server Links feature supports these categories:

- **Bug Report** (`issues`)
- **Community Guidelines** (`guidelines`) 
- **Discord** (`discord`)
- **Feedback** (`feedback`)
- **Forums** (`forum`)
- **News** (`news`)
- **Status** (`status`)
- **Support** (`support`)
- **Website** (`website`)

## Link Command Behavior

### Default Behavior

When a player uses a social link command:

1. **Message Display**: A formatted message appears in chat with the link
2. **Click Action**: Players can click the message to open the URL
3. **Hover Info**: Additional context appears on hover

### Permissions

Social link commands **do not require any permissions** by default. This ensures all players can access your community resources.

To restrict access to specific commands, you can:

```yaml
# Deny access to specific commands
- -tweaks.command.discord

# Or create custom permission groups
tweaks.links.staff:
- tweaks.command.feedback
- tweaks.command.issues
```

## Customization

### Message Formatting

You can customize the appearance of link messages in your translation files:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "discord": {
      "format": "<click:open_url:'{url}'><gradient:#5865F2:#7289DA>[Discord]</gradient> Join our community!</click>",
      "hover": "Click to join our Discord server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Conditional Links

You can make links conditional based on player permissions or other criteria:

```json
{
  "social": {
    "staff-feedback": {
      "enabled": true,
      "permission": "tweaks.links.staff",
      "url": "https://staff.yourserver.com/feedback"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### URL Configuration

1. **Use HTTPS** whenever possible for security
2. **Test all links** before deploying to production
3. **Keep URLs current** and monitor for broken links
4. **Use short URLs** for better chat display when needed

### Community Integration

1. **Consistent Branding**: Match your server's theme across all platforms
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Make it obvious what each link provides
3. **Strategic Selection**: Don't overwhelm players with too many options
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep content fresh and links active

### Server Links Tab

1. **Enable selectively**: Only show links that provide real value
2. **Prioritize important links**: Website, Discord, and rules are most important
3. **Test client integration**: Verify links work from the Minecraft client
4. **Monitor usage**: Remove unused links to keep the list clean

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Links not appearing in Server Links tab:**
- Verify `add-server-links` is enabled
- Check that URLs are properly formatted
- Ensure the server has restarted after configuration changes

**Commands not working:**
- Confirm `add-link-commands` is enabled
- Verify specific platform toggles are enabled
- Check for permission restrictions

**URLs not opening:**
- Test URLs in a web browser
- Ensure URLs use proper protocols (https://, ts3server://, etc.)
- Check client-side security settings

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot link registration:

```json
{
  "debug": {
    "log-link-registration": true
  }
}
```
