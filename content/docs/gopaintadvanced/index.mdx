# goPaintAdvanced

goPaintAdvanced (gpa) is a high-performance fork of the **goPaint** plugin,
designed to address the original's lack of maintenance, performance issues, and missing features.
With full **FastAsyncWorldEdit** integration, survival-friendly editing, and modern optimizations,
goPaintAdvanced delivers a vastly improved terrain painting experience.

## Features

### Performance & Compatibility

- **FastAsyncWorldEdit Support**: Properly leverages FAWE's features and improvements over standard WorldEdit
- **Insane Speed Improvements**: Faster algorithms and fully async editing for lag-free painting
- **Modern Server Support**: Completely refactored legacy code for maintainability and compatibility
- **Survival Friendly**: Edit support that works seamlessly in survival mode

### Brushes & Painting

- **All Original Brushes**: Every brush from goPaint is included and works as expected
- **Underlay Brush**: New brush that only paints blocks with blocks above them
- **Exposed Surface Mode**: Paints actual exposed blocks, unlike the original "visible" mode which only paints blocks in your line of sight
- **WorldEdit Mask Support**: Use any WorldEdit mask, including complex ones (original only supported single block masks)

### Configuration & Localization

- **More Configuration Options**: Fine-tune the plugin to your needs
- **Complete Localization**: Full l10n support for all messages and texts
- **Proper Developer API**: Clean API for developers to extend functionality

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

The main command of goPaintAdvanced is `/gopaint` (or `/gp`),
and provides expanded functionality over the original:

```
<gray># Open the goPaint GUI</gray>
/gp menu

<gray># Get the goPaint wand item</gray>
/gp wand

<gray># Toggle the brush on or off</gray>
/gp toggle

<gray># Change the brush size</gray>
/gp size <aqua><size></aqua>

<gray># Select a specific brush</gray>
/gp brush <aqua><brush></aqua>

<gray># Reload the configuration</gray>
/gp reload
```

### Brush Settings Export/Import

Save and share your brush configurations:
```
<gray># Export current brush settings to the item in hand</gray>
/gp export

<gray># Import brush settings from the held item into the GUI</gray>
/gp import
```

## Commands

| Command             | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/gp menu`          | Open the goPaint GUI                 |
| `/gp wand`          | Receive the goPaint wand item        |
| `/gp toggle`        | Enable or disable the brush          |
| `/gp size <size>`   | Change the brush size                |
| `/gp brush <brush>` | Select a specific brush              |
| `/gp export`        | Export brush settings to held item   |
| `/gp import`        | Import brush settings from held item |
| `/gp reload`        | Reload the configuration             |

## Surface Modes

### Exposed Mode (New)

The new **exposed** surface mode paints all blocks that are actually exposed to air,
regardless of your viewing angle. This is the intuitive behavior most users expect.

### Visible Mode (Original)

The original **visible** mode only paints blocks directly in your line of sight.
This can cause confusion when blocks that appear visible aren't painted due to
the raycast check not hitting them.

## Migrating from goPaint

goPaintAdvanced is designed as a drop-in replacement for goPaint:

- **Visual Compatibility**: The user interface remains mostly unchanged visually
- **Command Compatibility**: Original commands still work (`/gp toggle`, `/gp size`, `/gp reload`)
- **Feature Parity**: All original features are preserved and enhanced

Simply replace goPaint with goPaintAdvanced and enjoy the improvements!
