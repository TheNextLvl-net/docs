# Configuration

Portals provides configuration options to customize plugin behavior, teleportation mechanics, and performance settings.

## Configuration File Location

The main configuration file is located at: `plugins/Portals/config.json`  
Translation files for customizing messages are located in: `plugins/Portals/translations/`

<Callout type="info">
  Configuration files are auto-generated with default values on first run.  
  New options are automatically added when updating to newer versions.
</Callout>

## Configuration Options

| Setting                 | Description                                                | Default |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `allowCaveSpawns`       | Allow random teleports to consider caves as safe locations | `false` |
| `entryCosts`            | Enable or disable portal entry costs globally              | `true`  |
| `ignoreEntityMovement`  | Prevent non-player entities from interacting with portals  | `false` |
| `pushbackSpeed`         | Speed of the pushback effect                               | `0.3`   |

<Callout type="warn">
  Setting `entryCosts` to `false` will disable **ALL** portal costs, regardless of individual portal settings.
</Callout>

### Entity Interaction Settings

When enabled, only players can trigger portals.
Mobs, minecarts, and other entities will not be able to interact with or teleport through portals.

<Callout type="tip">
  **Performance Optimization**: Enable this option on servers with many entities to improve performance.  
  The performance gain depends on the number of entities on your server.
</Callout>

### Pushback Speed

When an entity is denied portal entry (due to lack of permission, insufficient funds, or active cooldown), this setting controls the pushback behavior.

**Speed Values:**
- **`0.3`** - Slow pushback (default, recommended)
- **`0.5`** - Slight pushback
- **`1.0`** - Relatively fast pushback
- **Higher values** - Faster pushback
- **`0` or below** - Disables pushback entirely

<Callout type="warn">
  Disabling pushback may cause entities to get stuck at portal boundaries.  
  It's recommended to use a low value like `0.3` or `0.5` for a better user experience.
