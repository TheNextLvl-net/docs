description: How to clone an existing group's data and options into a new group.
---

To clone a world group, use the command `/world group clone <group> <name>`.
This creates a new group with the same data and options as the source group.

## What gets cloned

All group data and options are copied to the new group,
e.g. difficulty, time, weather, gamerules, enabled state, and more.

## What does not get cloned

Group-specific data like spawn location, player data, or member worlds is **not** copied.

## Example

Cloning a group called "citybuild" into a new group called "farmworld":

```
/world group clone <aqua>citybuild</aqua> <yellow>farmworld</yellow>
```
