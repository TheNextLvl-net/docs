title: Group spawn point
description: How to set and remove spawn points for groups.
---

You can configure a custom spawn point for each group. The spawn point is used in the following situations:

- **Respawning after death**: If the player has no valid respawn point (e.g., no bed or respawn anchor),
  they will respawn at the group's spawn point.
- **Group entry**: When a player enters a group for the first time and has no previous location saved,
  or if teleportation to their previous location is disabled, they will be placed at the spawn point.
- **Teleportation**: When using the `/world group teleport` command, players are teleported to the
  group's spawn point (unless the last known location is used, see above).

## Set a spawn point

**Usage:** `/world group spawn set <group> [<world>] <position> [<rotation>]`

| Argument   | Description                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `group`    | The group to set the spawn point for.                     |
| `world`    | The world where the spawn point is located.               |
| `position` | The coordinates for the spawn point (x, y, z).            |
| `rotation` | Optional. The rotation (yaw, pitch) the player will face. |

### Example

Set a spawn point for the "citybuild" group at coordinates 100, 64, 200 in the world "spawn":

```
/world group spawn set <aqua>citybuild</aqua> <aqua>spawn</aqua> <aqua>100 64 200</aqua>
```

With rotation (facing north):

```
/world group spawn set <aqua>citybuild</aqua> <aqua>spawn</aqua> <aqua>100 64 200</aqua> <aqua>180 0</aqua>
```

## Remove a spawn point

**Usage:** `/world group spawn unset <group>`

### Example

Remove the spawn point for the "citybuild" group:

```
/world group spawn unset <aqua>citybuild</aqua>
```
