description: How to import existing group and player data from other plugins.
---

PerWorlds can import existing data from other per-world plugins, making it easy to switch
without losing your setup or player data.

**Usage:** `/world group import <provider>`

## Supported plugins

| Plugin                 | Status      |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Multiverse-Inventories | ✅ Supported |
| My_Worlds              | 🚧 Planned  |

## Example

Importing data from Multiverse-Inventories:

```
/world group import <aqua>Multiverse-Inventories</aqua>
```

This will import groups, player inventories, ender chests, stats, and other player data
from Multiverse-Inventories into PerWorlds.

<Callout type="warn">
  Only one import can run at a time. Wait for the current import to finish before starting another.
</Callout>
