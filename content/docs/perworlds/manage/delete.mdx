description: How to delete a group.
---

To delete a group, you can use the command `/world group delete <group>`.  
This will delete the specified group and all associated data, including player data and world data.  
Deleting a group restores the world and player data to the `unowned` group.

<Callout type="error" title="Caution">

Deleting a group is irreversible. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.  
 The group's entire folder will be permanently deleted.  
 This includes all player data, world data (_not the worlds themselves_), and any other associated files.
