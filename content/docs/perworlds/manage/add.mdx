description: How to add worlds to a group.
---

To add worlds to a group, you need to use the command `/world group add <world> <group>`.  
The `<world>` argument is the key of the world you want to add, and `<group>` is the name of the group you want to add it to.

## Example [!toc]

Adding all farmworlds to the group "farmworld":

```
/world group add farmworld:normal farmworld
/world group add farmworld:nether farmworld
/world group add farmworld:the_end farmworld
```
