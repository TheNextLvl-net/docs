description: How to manage world group options.

World group options allow you to enable or disable certain features for all worlds in a group.

To manage world group options, you can use the command `/world group option <option> <group> [<value>]`.  
The `value` argument is optional and can be either `true` or `false`.  
If you provide a value, it will set the option for the specified group.  
If you omit the value, it will display the current value of the option for the specified group.

If an option is disabled, the vanilla default will be used for all worlds in the group.  
For example, if the `inventory` option is disabled, a player's inventory will be cleared upon entering the group.  
The player state will not change when switching between worlds within the same group.

## Example [!toc]

To disable a group entirely, you can use the command:

```
/world group option enabled <aqua>farmworld</aqua> <yellow>false</yellow>
```

To query the current value of an option, you can use the command:

```
/world group option inventory <aqua>farmworld</aqua>
```
