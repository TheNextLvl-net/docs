description: How to remove a world from a group.
---

To remove a world from a group, you can use the command `/world group remove <group> <world>`.  
This will remove the specified world from the specified group.

<Callout type="info" title="Important">
  
  Removing a world from a group does not delete any data associated with the group itself.  
  The data of all players currently in the group, as well as the world data will be saved and then changed to the `unowned` group data.

</Callout>

### Example [!toc]

```
/world group remove farmworld worlds:void
```
