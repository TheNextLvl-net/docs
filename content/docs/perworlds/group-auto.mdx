description: How to automatically create groups for existing worlds.
---

To automatically create groups for all existing worlds, use the command `/world group auto`.
This command has no arguments and uses a smart detection system to determine which worlds should be grouped together.

The detection system analyzes world names and keys to automatically group worlds that belong together, such as overworld, nether, and end dimensions of the same world.

## Behavior

- **Non-destructive**: This command only affects worlds that aren't already in a group.  
  Existing group assignments are preserved.
- **Uses existing groups**: If a world has no group but a matching group already exists,  
  it will be added to that existing group rather than creating a new one.
- **Namespace-aware**: Worlds with similar names but different namespaces (keys)  
  will not be grouped together.

## Example

Running the command:

```
/world group auto
```

This will automatically detect and group related worlds. For instance, if you have the following worlds:

- `farmworld`
- `farmworld_nether`
- `farmworld_the_end`

The command will automatically create a group called "farmworld" and add all three worlds to it.
