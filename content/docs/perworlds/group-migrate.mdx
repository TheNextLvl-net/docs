title: Migrating player data
description: How to set a migration group and move existing player data.
---

PerWorlds requires you to set a migration group before use. This tells the plugin which group
to use when it first encounters a player.

On existing servers, this moves player data (inventories, advancements, statistics, etc.)
from Minecraft's default location into the specified group. On new servers without any
player data yet, this step is still required — PerWorlds needs to know which group to use by default.

**Usage:** `/world group migrate <group>`

## Example

If you want your existing player data to be moved to a group called "citybuild":

```
/world group migrate <aqua>citybuild</aqua>
```

From now on, whenever a player joins who has never been seen by PerWorlds before,
their existing Minecraft data will automatically be moved into the "citybuild" group.

## Important notes

- **Always required**: This command must be run when setting up PerWorlds, regardless of whether
  your server already has player data or is brand new.
- **Only affects new players to PerWorlds**: The migration only applies to players who don't
  already have data stored by PerWorlds. If PerWorlds has already saved data for a player,
  their original Minecraft data won't be touched.
- **Changing the migration group**: If you change the migration target to a different group later,
  only players who haven't been seen by PerWorlds yet will have their data moved to the new group.
  Players who already have PerWorlds data will keep their existing data.

<Callout type="info">
  Think of it this way: PerWorlds only migrates a player's data once — the first time it sees them.
  After that, PerWorlds manages their data directly.
