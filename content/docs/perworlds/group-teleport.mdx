**Usage:** `/world group teleport <group> [<players>]`

This command teleports a player to the specified group. The player will be placed at either
their last known location in that group, or at the group's spawn point if no previous location
exists or if teleportation to the previous location is disabled.

## Examples

Teleport yourself to the "citybuild" group:

```
/world group teleport <aqua>citybuild</aqua>
```

Teleport everyone to the "citybuild" group:

```
/world group teleport <aqua>citybuild</aqua> <yellow>@a</yellow>
```
