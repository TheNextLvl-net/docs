# PerWorlds

PerWorlds is a powerful per-world inventory plugin for **Paper** servers, allowing you to group multiple worlds together with separate inventories, advancements, statistics, gamerules, and much more.

Think of it as a modern, feature-rich alternative to **Multiverse-Inventories** with significantly more options and flexibility.

## Features

### World Groups

- **Flexible Grouping**: Group multiple worlds together to share player data
- **Unlimited Groups**: Create as many world groups as you need
- **Easy Management**: Add or remove worlds from groups at any time
- **Group Spawns**: Set custom spawn points for each group

### Per-Group Data Separation

- **Inventories**: Separate player inventories per group
- **Ender Chests**: Keep ender chest contents isolated per group
- **Advancements**: Track advancements separately for each group
- **Statistics**: Maintain separate statistics per group
- **Experience**: Isolate XP and levels between groups
- **Health & Hunger**: Separate survival states per group

### Advanced Sync Options

- **40+ Configurable Options**: Fine-tune exactly what data is synced per group
- **Player States**: Control fly state, gamemode, potion effects, and more
- **World Settings**: Sync gamerules, difficulty, time, weather, and world borders
- **Messages**: Configure per-group chat, join/quit messages, and death messages
- **Tab List**: Show only players in the same group

### Seamless Integration

- **Worlds Plugin**: Works seamlessly with [Worlds](/docs/worlds) (recommended for world management)
- **Other World Managers**: Compatible with any world management plugin
- **Purpur Support**: Extended ender chest rows are fully supported

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

The main command is `/world group`, which requires the permission `perworlds.admin`:

```
<gray># Automatically group all existing worlds</gray>
/world group auto

<gray># Create a new world group</gray>
/world group create <aqua>farmworld</aqua>

<gray># Add worlds to the group</gray>
/world group add <aqua>farmworld:normal</aqua> <yellow>farmworld</yellow>
/world group add <aqua>farmworld:nether</aqua> <yellow>farmworld</yellow>
/world group add <aqua>farmworld:the_end</aqua> <yellow>farmworld</yellow>

<gray># List all groups</gray>
/world group list

<gray># View group information</gray>
/world group info <aqua>farmworld</aqua>
```

#### Configuring Group Options

Customize what data is synced for a specific group:

```
<gray># Disable inventory sync (players get empty inventory)</gray>
/world group option inventory <aqua>farmworld</aqua> <yellow>false</yellow>

<gray># Enable per-group chat</gray>
/world group option chat <aqua>farmworld</aqua> <yellow>true</yellow>

<gray># Query current option value</gray>
/world group option gameMode <aqua>farmworld</aqua>
```

### First-Time Setup

PerWorlds requires you to set a migration group before use.  
This tells the plugin where to move player data when it first encounters a player:

```
<gray># Set the migration group</gray>
/world group migrate <aqua>citybuild</aqua>
```

On existing servers, this ensures your players' inventories, advancements, and other data
are moved into the specified group. On new servers without any player data yet, this step
is still required — PerWorlds needs to know which group to use by default.
See [Migrating player data](/docs/perworlds/group-migrate) for more details.
