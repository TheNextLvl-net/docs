## What is PerWorlds? [!toc]

PerWorlds is a plugin that allows you to group multiple worlds together, each with its own unique settings and configurations.
This also allows you to have **player data**, **inventories**, **gamerules**, and other settings that are specific to **each** world **group**.

As a quick comparison, you can think of **PerWorlds** as **Multiverse Inventories** but with much more features and higher flexibility.

<Callout type="error">
  PerWorlds does not support Folia at the moment, there are still too many technical limitations.
