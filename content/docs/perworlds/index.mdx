# PerWorlds [!toc]

PerWorlds is a plugin that allows you to group multiple worlds together, each with its own unique settings and configurations.
This also allows you to have **player data**, **inventories**, **gamerules**, and other settings that are specific to **each** world **group**.

As a quick comparison, you can think of **PerWorlds** as **Multiverse Inventories** but with much more features and higher flexibility.

PerWorlds is designed to work seamlessly with [Worlds](/docs/worlds), but can also be used on its own.  
It supports grouping worlds for separate inventories, advancements, statistics, gamerules, and more.  
You can easily manage world groups, add or remove worlds, and configure options per group.
