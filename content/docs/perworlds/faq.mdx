    title="What is PerWorlds and how does it work?"
    id="what-is"
  >
    **PerWorlds** is a plugin that allows you to have separate inventories, advancements, statistics, and more for each world or group of worlds on your Minecraft server.  
    It is designed to work seamlessly with [Worlds](../worlds) but can also be used on its own.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Which server software does PerWorlds support?"
    id="server-software"
  >
    The only officially supported and recommended server software is [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper).  
    Forks like [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) and [Pufferfish](https://pufferfish.host/downloads) are known to work too.
    
    <Callout type="info">
      Purpur provides an option to extend the maximum number of enderchest rows, which is supported by PerWorlds.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="error" title="Note">
      Support will not be provided for non-paper based server software or unknown, arbitrary forks.
      Hybrids that try to support both mods and plugins are completely unsupported and will most likely not work.
