# RedProtect

RedProtect is designed to prevent malicious redstone constructions that may cause lag on your Minecraft server.
It monitors redstone activity and automatically disables problematic redstone clocks before they can impact server performance.

## Features

- **Plot-based redstone clock protection** - Protect individual plots from redstone clocks
- **Area-based redstone clock protection** - Guard areas against redstone clocks
- **Chunk-based redstone clock protection** - Monitor and protect entire chunks
- **TPS-based redstone deactivation** - Automatically disable all redstone when server TPS drops

## Supported Plugins

RedProtect integrates with these protection plugins:

- [PlotSquared](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared) - For plot-based protection
- [Protect](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/protect) - For area-based protection

## How It Works

RedProtect monitors redstone activity across your server and tracks the number of block updates in specific regions
(plots, areas, or chunks).
When a region exceeds the configured update limit within the detection interval,
RedProtect identifies it as a redstone clock and automatically disables it for a specified duration.

Additionally, if your server's TPS drops below the configured threshold,
RedProtect can automatically disable all redstone activity server-wide until performance recovers.
