You can customize character skins in a few different ways using the `/character skin` command.

## Changing a Character's Skin

To change a character's skin, you can use the command  
`/character skin set <character> [player|file|url] <value> [slim]`.

<Callout type="info">
  The `slim` option is used to apply a slim skin model, which is typically used for characters with
  a slimmer build. Omitting this option will apply the default (classic) skin model.
</Callout>

## Applying a Player Skin

To change a character's skin to an existing player's skin,  
you can use the command `/character skin set <character> player <player> [slim]`.

<Callout type="warning" title="Skin Not Found">
  Mojang is ratelimiting the use of player skins. If a skin is not found, it may be due to this
  ratelimiting. In this case just try again later. If the skin is still not found, it may be due to
  the player not having a skin set or the player not existing. You can also try using a different
  method to set the skin, such as using a file or URL.
</Callout>

### Example [!toc]

Classic skins can be applied using the following command:

```
/character skin set MyCharacter player Notch
```

To apply a slim skin, just append the `slim` option:

```
/character skin set MyCharacter player Notch slim
```

## Applying a Skin from File

You can change a character's skin using a file with the command  
`/character skin set <character> file <file> [slim]`.

<Callout type="info" title="File Requirements" id="file-requirements">
Skin files must be in **PNG format** and be of **64x64 pixels**.

The file can be located anywhere on the system, but you must provide the full path to the file.  
If the file is located in the server's main directory, you can use a relative path.

</Callout>

### Example [!toc]

To change a character's skin using a file, you can use the following command:

```
/character skin set MyCharacter file "/home/skins/my_skin.png"
```

## Applying a Skin from URL

You can change a character's skin using a URL with the command  
`/character skin set <character> url <url> [slim]`.

<Callout type="info" title="URL Requirements" id="url-requirements">
  The URL must be a direct link to a PNG image file that conforms with the [Skin File
  Requirements](#file-requirements).
</Callout>

### Example [!toc]

To change a character's skin using a URL, you can use the following command:

```
/character skin set MyCharacter url "https://example.com/skin.png"
```

## Resetting a Skin

To reset a character's skin to default, you can use the following command:

```
/character skin reset MyCharacter
```

<Callout type="info">This will only reset the skin, not the skin layers.</Callout>

## Skin Layers

To customize a character's skin layers, you can use the command  
`/character skin layer [hide|show] <layer> <character>`.

By default, all layers are shown. You can hide or show each layer individually.

### Example [!toc]

To hide a character's cape layer, you can use the following command:

```
/character skin layer hide cape MyCharacter
```
