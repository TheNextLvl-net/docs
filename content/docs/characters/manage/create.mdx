description: How to create a new character.
---

To create a new character, use the command `/character create <name> [<type>]`.  
Type `type` is optional, all entity types can be found on the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity#Types_of_entities).  
If you do not specify a type, the default type is `minecraft:player`.

## Example [!toc]

To create a player character named "Steve", you can use the following command:

```
/character create <aqua>Steve</aqua> <yellow>minecraft:player</yellow>
```

To create a zombie character named "Zed", you would use:

```
/character create <aqua>Zed</aqua> <yellow>minecraft:zombie</yellow>
```
