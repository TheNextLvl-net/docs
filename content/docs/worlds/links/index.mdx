description: Link your worlds to restore vanilla portal travel behavior

## How do links work? [!toc]

World links allow you to connect up to three worlds together, enabling players to travel between them as if they were part of the same world.
This is aimed for restoring the vanilla portal travel behavior, where players can use Nether and End portals to travel between dimensions.

<Callout type="info">
  You can only link one of each dimension type together, so you can link one Overworld, one Nether,
  and one End world.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  Links are not intended as a way to create custom portals, but rather to restore the original
  vanilla behavior.
