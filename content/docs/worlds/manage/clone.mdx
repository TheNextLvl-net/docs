title: Clone a world
---

To clone a world you can use the `/world clone <world> <key> [template]` command.  
This command creates a copy of the specified world, allowing you to work on a separate instance without affecting the original.

The `template` option defines whether the cloned world should be regenerated or an exact copy of the original world.

Example on how to create an exact copy of a world (1:1):

```
/world clone worlds:my_world my_world_copy
```

Example on how to clone a world's generation settings (no region data, scoreboards, player data, etc.):

```
/world clone worlds:my_world my_world_copy template
```
