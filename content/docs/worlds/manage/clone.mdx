description: How to use the world clone command.
---

To clone a world you can use the `/world clone <world>` command.  
This command creates a copy of the specified world, allowing you to work on a separate instance without affecting the original.  
There are three options: `name`, `key`, and `full`.  
If you don't specify any of these options, the cloned world will have an auto generated name and key, and the world data will be copied 1:1.

The `full` option defines whether the cloned world should be regenerated or an exact copy of the original world.

Example on how to create an exact copy of a world:

```
/world clone <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua>
```

Example on how to clone a world's generation settings (no world data, scoreboards, player data, etc.):

```
/world clone <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> full <yellow>false</yellow>
```

You can define the name and key of a cloned world by using the `name` and `key` options:

```
/world clone <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> name <yellow>"my world copy"</yellow> key <green>my_world_copy</green>
```
