description: How to use the world clone command.

To clone a world you can use the `/world clone <world> <key> [template]` command.  
This command creates a copy of the specified world, allowing you to work on a separate instance without affecting the original.

The `template` option defines whether the cloned world should be regenerated or an exact copy of the original world.

Example on how to create an exact copy of a world (1:1):

```
/world clone <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>my_world_copy</yellow>
```

Example on how to clone a world's generation settings (no region data, scoreboards, player data, etc.):

```text
/world clone <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>my_world_copy</yellow> template
```
