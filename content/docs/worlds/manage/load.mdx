description: How to use the world load command.
---

You can load existing worlds with the `/world load <world>` command.  
You can only load worlds that are managed by Worlds,
if you want to load a world that is not managed by Worlds, [import](/docs/worlds/manage/import) the world instead.

## Example

```
/world load MyWorld
```
