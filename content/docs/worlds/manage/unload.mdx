description: How to use the world unload command.
---

You can unload worlds with the `/world unload <world> [<fallback>]` command.  
The fallback option allows you to specify a world to send players to, if they are currently in the world that is being unloaded.  
If undefined, players will be sent to the default world (usually `minecraft:overworld`).

## Example

```
/world unload worlds:my_world worlds:my_fallback_world
```
