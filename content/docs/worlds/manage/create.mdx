title: Create a new world
---

You can create new worlds with the `/world create <key>` command.   
There are three options `generator`, `type`, and `preset`.

To access the `/world create` command, the permission `worlds.command.create` is required

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  `<key>` is the identifier of the world.   
  New worlds are created under the `worlds` namespace if not specified otherwise.
  
  Allowed are alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, dots, and slashes.   
  The key format accepts `namespace:key` or `key`.

  **Why keys and not names?**

  Both the minecraft server as well as the client use keys to identify worlds.   
  Mods and shaders may use the key to differentiate worlds.
</Callout>

## Generator

To generate a new world using a custom generator, use the command   
`/world create <key> generator <generator> [<dimension>] [<structures>] [<seed>]`   
The generator argument takes the name of the plugin that provides the custom chunk generator or biome provider.

For example:
```
/world create city:plots generator PlotSquared
```
