## Additional options [!toc]

The import command also supports the following additional options:

- `dimension` - Specifies the [dimension type](create#available-dimensions). Defaults to `normal`.
- `generator` - Specifies the world generator plugin to use for generating the world.
- `key` - Sets the key for the world. Creates a key representation of the world name if not provided.
- `name` - Sets the name for the world. If not provided, the world will be imported with its original name.

Options are specified as `option value` pairs, and can be used in any given order.

## Examples [!toc]

To import a specific dimension of a world, you can use the following command:

```
/world import <aqua>End</aqua> key <yellow>worlds:end</yellow> dimension <green>end</green>
```

To import a world with a specific generator, you can use the following command:
