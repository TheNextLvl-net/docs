description: How to use the world regenerate command.
---

To regenerate a world you can use the `/world regenerate <world> [<flags>]` command.  
This command will regenerate the specified world, so use it with caution.

<Callout type="error" title="Caution">

Regenerating a world is irreversible. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.  
 The world's entire progress will be permanently deleted.

</Callout>

## Flags [!toc]

- `--confirm`: This flag is required to confirm the regeneration of the world.
  It is a safety measure to prevent accidental regenerations.
- `--schedule`: This flag schedules the regeneration of the world to the server shutdown process.  
  The regeneration of `minecraft:overworld` can only be scheduled as it is required to always exist during runtime.

To simply regenerate a world, you can use the following command:

```
/world regenerate <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>--confirm</yellow>
```

To schedule the regeneration of a world, you can use:

```
/world regenerate <aqua>minecraft:overworld</aqua> <yellow>--confirm --schedule</yellow>
```
