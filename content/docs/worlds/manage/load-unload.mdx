## Loading worlds

You can load existing worlds with the `/world load <world>` command.  
You can only load worlds that are managed by Worlds,
if you want to load a world that is not managed by Worlds, [import](/docs/worlds/manage/import) the world instead.

### Example [!toc]

```
/world load <aqua>MyWorld</aqua>
```

## Unloading worlds

You can unload worlds with the `/world unload <world> [<fallback>]` command.  
The fallback option allows you to specify a world to send players to, if they are currently in the world that is being unloaded.  
If undefined, players will be sent to the default world (usually `minecraft:overworld`).

### Example [!toc]

```
/world unload <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>worlds:my_fallback_world</yellow>
```
