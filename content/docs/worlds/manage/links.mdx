## What are world links?

World links allow you to connect up to three worlds together, enabling players to travel between them as if they were part of the same world.
This is aimed for restoring the vanilla portal travel behavior, where players can use Nether and End portals to travel between dimensions.

<Callout type="info">
  You can only link one of each dimension type together, so you can link one Overworld, one Nether,
  and one End world.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  Links are not intended as a way to create custom portals, but rather to restore the original
  vanilla behavior.
</Callout>

## Creating world links

To create a world link you need to have at least two worlds created.  
You can create a link by using the command `/world link create <world> <destination>`.

The `<world>` argument has to be a world of the dimension type `Overworld`.  
The `<destination>` world must be a `Nether` or `End` dimension.

## Example [!toc]

Linking an **Overworld** to a **Nether** world:

```
/world link create farmworld:normal farmworld:nether
```

Linking an **Overworld** to an **End** world:

```
/world link create farmworld:normal farmworld:the_end
```

## Removing world links

Removing a world link is straightforward.  
You can remove a link by using the command `/world link remove <world> <destination>`.

## Example [!toc]

Removing the link between an **Overworld** and a **Nether** world:

```
/world link remove farmworld:normal farmworld:nether
```

Removing the link between an **Overworld** and an **End** world:

```
/world link remove farmworld:normal farmworld:the_end
```
