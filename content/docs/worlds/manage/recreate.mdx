description: How to use the world recreate command.
---

To recreate a world you can use the `/world recreate <world> <name>` command.  
This command creates a modified instance of the specified world.  
The same options as in [`/world create`](create#additional-options) apply: `bonus-chest`, `seed`, `structures`, `hardcore`, `key`, and `dimension`.  
If you don't specify any of these options, the recreated world will have an auto generated name and key, and the world options will be copied 1:1.

Example on how to recreate a world with a different seed:

```
/world recreate <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>"recreated world"</yellow> seed <green>Hawaii</green>
```

Example on how to recreate a world without structures:

```
/world recreate <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>"recreated world"</yellow> structures <green>false</green>
```
