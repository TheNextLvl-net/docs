description: How to use the world delete command.
---

To delete a world you can use the `/world delete <world> [<flags>]` command.  
This command will permanently delete the specified world, so use it with caution.

<Callout type="error" title="Caution">

Deleting a world is irreversible. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.  
 The world's entire folder will be permanently deleted.

</Callout>

## Flags [!toc]

- `--confirm`: This flag is required to confirm the deletion of the world.
  It is a safety measure to prevent accidental deletions.
- `--schedule`: This flag schedules the deletion of the world to the server shutdown process.
  This option is required to be set on Folia servers, as they cannot delete worlds while they are running.
  Also the `minecraft:overworld` can only be scheduled as it is required to always exist during runtime.

## Examples [!toc]

To simply delete a world, you can use the following command:

```
/world delete worlds:my_world --confirm
```

To schedule the deletion of a world, you can use:

```
/world delete minecraft:overworld --confirm --schedule
```
