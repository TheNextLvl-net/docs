# Save Commands

World save commands allow you to control when and how world data is saved to disk.

## /world save

Saves a specific world to disk.

**Usage:** `/world save <world>`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.save`

<Callout type="info">
  See the [Permissions page](/docs/worlds/permissions) for all command permissions.
</Callout>

### Example

```
/world save <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua>
```

## /world save-all

Saves all loaded worlds to disk.

**Usage:** `/world save-all`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.save-all`

<Callout type="info">
  This command is also available as a standalone command: `/save-all`
</Callout>

### Example

```
/world save-all
```

## /world save-off

Disables automatic saving for all worlds. This prevents the server from automatically saving world data.

**Usage:** `/world save-off`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.save-off`

<Callout type="warning">
  Use this command with caution. Disabling auto-save can lead to data loss if the server crashes.
  Make sure to manually save worlds regularly or re-enable auto-save when done.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  This command is also available as a standalone command: `/save-off`
</Callout>

### Example

/world save-off
```

## /world save-on

Re-enables automatic saving for all worlds after it has been disabled with `/world save-off`.

## Use Cases

### Performance Optimization

Disable auto-save during intensive operations:

<gray># Perform intensive operations</gray>
/world save-all
/world save-on
```

### Backup Preparation

Ensure all worlds are saved before creating a backup:
```
/world save-all
```

### Individual World Maintenance

Save a specific world after making changes:
```
/world save <aqua>worlds:creative</aqua>
```
