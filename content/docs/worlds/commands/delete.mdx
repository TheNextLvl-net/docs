# Delete a World

**Usage:** `/world delete <world> [<flags>]`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.delete`

<Callout type="info">
  See the [Permissions page](/docs/worlds/permissions) for all command permissions.
</Callout>

To delete a world you can use the `/world delete <world> [<flags>]` command.  
This command will permanently delete the specified world, so use it with caution.

<Callout type="error" title="Caution">

Deleting a world is irreversible. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.  
 The world's entire folder will be permanently deleted.

</Callout>

## Flags

- `--confirm`: This flag is required to confirm the deletion of the world.
  It is a safety measure to prevent accidental deletions.
- `--schedule`: This flag schedules the deletion of the world to the server shutdown process.  
  The deletion of `minecraft:overworld` can only be scheduled as it is required to always exist during runtime.

## Examples

To simply delete a world, you can use the following command:

```
/world delete <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>--confirm</yellow>
```

To schedule the deletion of a world, you can use:

```
/world delete <aqua>minecraft:overworld</aqua> <yellow>--confirm --schedule</yellow>
```
