## Flags

- `--confirm`: This flag is required to confirm the regeneration of the world.
  It is a safety measure to prevent accidental regenerations.
- `--schedule`: This flag schedules the regeneration of the world to the server shutdown process.  
  The regeneration of `minecraft:overworld` can only be scheduled as it is required to always exist during runtime.
- `--seed`: This flag allows you to reroll the world seed.  
  This can be useful if you want to create a new world with the same name but a different seed.

To simply regenerate a world, you can use the following command:

```
/world regenerate <aqua>worlds:my_world</aqua> <yellow>--confirm</yellow>
```

To regenerate a world and reroll its seed, you can use:

```
/world regenerate <aqua>citybuild:farmworld/nether</aqua> <yellow>--confirm --seed</yellow>
```

To schedule the regeneration of a world, you can use:

```
/world regenerate <aqua>minecraft:overworld</aqua> <yellow>--confirm --schedule</yellow>
```
