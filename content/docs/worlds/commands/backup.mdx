# Backup Commands

World backup commands allow you to create, manage, and restore backups of your worlds.

## /world backup create

Creates a backup of one or more worlds.

**Usage:** `/world backup create <world> [<name>]`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.backup.create`

<Callout type="info">
  See the [Permissions page](/docs/worlds/permissions) for all command permissions.
</Callout>

### Arguments

- `<world>` - The world to backup, or `*` to backup all worlds
- `[<name>]` - Optional custom name for the backup. If not specified, uses the pattern `yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss.zip`

### Backup Location

Backups are stored in the backup folder, which can be configured using:
1. Environment variable: `WORLDS_BACKUP_FOLDER`
2. System property: `worlds.backup.folder`
3. Default location: `…/backups/<world-name>/`

For example, backups for a world named "myworld" would be stored in `…/backups/myworld/` by default.
The default location is relative to the server's world container folder which can be [changed](/docs/worlds/faq#world-container).

### Examples

Create a backup with automatic timestamp name:
```
/world backup create <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua>
```

Create a backup with a custom name:
```
/world backup create <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>pre-update-backup</yellow>
```

Backup all worlds at once:
```
/world backup create *
```

Backup all worlds with a custom name:
```
/world backup create * <aqua>weekly-backup</aqua>
```

## /world backup delete

Deletes a specific backup.

**Usage:** `/world backup delete <world> <backup>`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.backup.delete`

### Arguments

- `<world>` - The world whose backup you want to delete
- `<backup>` - The name of the backup to delete

### Example

Delete a specific backup:
```
/world backup delete <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>2024-01-15_14-30-00.zip</yellow>
```

## /world backup list

Lists all backups for a world, sorted by age from most recent to oldest.

**Usage:** `/world backup list <world>`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.backup.list`

### Arguments

- `<world>` - The world whose backups you want to list

### Information Displayed

The list command shows for each backup:

- **Backup Name** - The name of the backup file
- **Age** - How long ago the backup was created
- **Size** - The size of the backup on disk

<Callout type="tip">
  Backup entries in the list are interactive! Hover over a backup to see quick actions, and click to quickly restore or delete backups.
</Callout>

```
/world backup list <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua>
```

## /world backup restore

**Usage:** `/world backup restore <world> <backup>`

**Permission:** `worlds.command.backup.restore`

### Arguments

- `<world>` - The world to restore
- `<backup>` - The backup to restore from, or `latest` to restore the most recent backup

### Examples

Restore the most recent backup:
```
/world backup restore <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>latest</yellow>
```

Restore a specific backup:
```
/world backup restore <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>pre-update-backup.zip</yellow>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Restoring a backup will replace the current world data. Make sure to create a backup of the current state before restoring if needed.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

### Regular Backups

Create automated backups before major changes:
```
/world backup create <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>before-event</yellow>
```

### Disaster Recovery

Restore a world after corruption or unwanted changes:
```
<gray># List available backups</gray>
/world backup list <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua>
<gray># Restore the most recent backup</gray>
/world backup restore <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>latest</yellow>
```

### Server Maintenance

Backup all worlds before a server update:
```
/world backup create * <aqua>pre-1.21-update</aqua>
```

### Cleanup Old Backups

Remove outdated backups to save disk space:
```
<gray># List backups to find old ones</gray>
/world backup list <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua>
<gray># Delete specific old backups</gray>
/world backup delete <aqua>worlds:survival</aqua> <yellow>2023-12-01_10-00-00</yellow>
```

### Testing and Experimentation

Create a backup before testing new features:
```
/world backup create <aqua>worlds:creative</aqua> <yellow>before-testing</yellow>
<gray># Test your changes...</gray>
<gray># Restore if needed</gray>
/world backup restore <aqua>worlds:creative</aqua> <yellow>before-testing</yellow>
