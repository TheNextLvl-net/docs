import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion"

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion
    title="I want to use Worlds and PerWorlds but my server doesn't start, what do I do?"
    id="perworlds"
  >
    In previous versions, **Worlds** already came bundled with **PerWorlds**.  
    You can either **update Worlds** (highly recommended), or **remove** the **PerWorlds jar** file from your plugins directory.

    <Callout type="info" title="Note">
      Since version 3.3.0, Worlds no longer includes PerWorlds.<br/>
      If you want to use PerWorlds, you have to install it [separately](https://modrinth.com/project/lpfQmSV2).
    </Callout>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Error on startup, what do I do?"
    id="error"
  >
    > ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchFieldError, InvocationTargetException, NullPointerException
    
    If you receive one of these errors on startup, it most likely means that your **server** version is **outdated**.   
    If you are running [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), make sure to use the most up to date branch.   
    If you are running Paper, make sure to use the latest build from their [website](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).
    
    <span className="text-sm italic">
      If updating doesn't fix your problem, please [look for similar issues](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/Worlds/issues?q=is%3Aissue) 
      on our GitHub or [open one](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/worlds/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) if you can't find anything helpful

  <Accordion 
    title="Does Worlds support Folia?"
    id="folia"
  >
    Yes, since version 2.1.0 (Minecraft 1.21.4) Worlds officially supports Folia.   
    There are some limitations but we are working on solutions to those problems.

    The most noticeable limitation is that world linking only works for end portals, but not for nether portals.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="How do World Links work?"
    id="links"
  >
    World **Links** only **restore** vanilla behavior for **portal travel** between 2 or 3 dimensions.   
    Links can only link one **overworld** to one **nether** and/or one **end** dimension.   
    _This feature is not intended to be used for custom portals._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Will Worlds ever support older Minecraft versions?"
    id="old-versions"
  >
    No, we do not aim to support any previous version of the game.   
    Unlike other world management plugins, Worlds is exclusively made for modern servers offering modern features.   
    Regarding Folia, Worlds only supports Minecraft 1.21.4 and above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="Which server software does Worlds support?"
    id="server-software"
  >
    The only officially supported and recommended server software are [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) and [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia)
    although forks like [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) and [Pufferfish](https://pufferfish.host/downloads) work as well.  
    The Folia forks [Foldenor](https://github.com/Edenor-Minecraft/Foldenor), [Luminol](https://github.com/LuminolMC/Luminol), and [CanvasMC](https://canvasmc.io/) are known to work too.

    <Callout type="error" title="Note">
      Support will not be provided for non-paper based server software or unknown, arbitrary forks.
      Non-paper based server software will probably never be supported.
      Hybrids that try to support both mods and plugins are completely unsupported and will most likely not work.
    </Callout>
    <Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
      Some forks of Folia might cause problems in certain situations.<br/>
      For reference see [#8](https://github.com/Edenor-Minecraft/Foldenor/issues/8) and [#98](https://github.com/LuminolMC/Luminol/issues/98)
    </Callout>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Can I store my worlds in a seperate directory?"
    id="world-container"
  >
    **Yes**, you can **configure** Worlds to load worlds from another **directory**.   
    **Bukkit** offers a simple **option** for this, see
    [#world-container](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/reference/bukkit-configuration/#settings_world_container)
    
    <Callout type="warn" title="Note">
      If you configure a custom `world-container`, world migration is not handled automatically.   
      You have to move your world directories to your defined folder by hand.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Which version of Worlds should I choose?"
    id="version"
  >
    <Callout title="Important">
      You will only get support for the latest version of Worlds.   
      If you encounter any issues while running an older build, you will not receive any support.
    </Callout>
    
    If you are **not** running the **latest** version of Paper, visit [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/gBIw3Gvy/versions)
    and look for the latest version supporting your server version.   
    For even older server versions, see the list below.
    
    [Latest version supporting 1.20.6 (Java 21)](https://modrinth.com/project/gBIw3Gvy/version/1.2.5)   
    [Latest version supporting 1.19/1.20.4 (Java 19)](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/worlds/versions/1.1.6)   
    [Latest version supporting 1.19/1.20.4 (Java 17)](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/worlds/versions/1.1.3)

    _For any version not listed here or on Modrinth, see [#old-versions](#old-versions)._

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="I want to update from v1 to v2, what do I have to consider?"
    id="upgrade-v2"
  >
    Before upgrading to v2, you should delete the entire `plugins/Worlds` folder and all `*.image` files
    in your server directory since these files are no longer used.
    After cleaning up, you'll need to import your worlds using   
    `/world import <world> [<key>] [<dimension>] [<generator>]`   
    and recreate world links using `/world link create <source> <destination>`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="What does <key> stand for, in command arguments?"
    id="key-argument"
  >
    `<key>` is the identifier of the world.   
    New worlds are created under the `worlds` namespace if not specified otherwise.
    
    Allowed are alphanumeric characters, underscores, dashes, dots, and slashes.   
    The key format accepts `namespace:key` or `key`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="What are keys used for?"
    id="why-keys"
  >
    Both the Minecraft server as well as the client use keys to identify worlds.   
    Mods and shaders may use the key to differentiate worlds.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="How does Worlds handle external world creator plugins?"
    id="thrird-party-worlds"
  >
    Worlds does not interfere with external world creator plugins.  
    If you use a third-party plugin to create worlds, there is not need to import them into Worlds.  
    Worlds will automatically detect and manage these worlds as long as they are in the world container.  
    Loading will be handled by the third-party plugin.
    
    <Callout type="warn">
      Some plugins might break if you delete or unload worlds created by them, so be careful when doing so.
