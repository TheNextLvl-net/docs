  <Accordion
    title="I want to use Worlds and PerWorlds but my server doesn't start, what do I do?"
    id="perworlds"
  >
    **Worlds** already **bundles PerWorlds**.   
    You can safely **remove** the **PerWorlds jar** file from your plugins directory.   
    Paper will prevent the server startup if the **same plugin** is installed **twice**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Error on startup, what do I do?"
    id="error"
  >
    > ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchFieldError, InvocationTargetException, NullPointerException
    
    If you receive one of these errors on startup, it most likely means that your **server** version is **outdated**.   
    If you are running [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), make sure to use the most up to date branch.   
    If you are running Paper, make sure to use the latest build from their [website](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).

  <Accordion 
    title="Does Worlds support Folia?"
    id="folia"
  >
    Yes, since version 2.1.0 (Minecraft 1.21.4) Worlds officially supports Folia.   
    There are some limitations but we are working on solutions to those problems.   
    Current limitations include:
    - World unloading
    - PerWorlds (completely disabled on Folia)
    - Daylight cycle is stuck in non default worlds
    - Mob AI behaves strangely in non default worlds

  <Accordion 
    title="How do World Links work?"
    id="links"
  >
    World **Links** only **restore** vanilla behavior for **portal travel** between 2 or 3 dimensions.   
    Links can only link one **overworld** to one **nether** and/or one **end** dimension.   
    _This feature is not intended to be used for custom portals._
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Will Worlds ever support older Minecraft versions?"
    id="old-versions"
  >
    No, we do not aim to support any previous version of the game.   
    Unlike other world management plugins, Worlds is exclusively made for modern servers offering modern features.   
    Regarding Folia, Worlds only supports Minecraft 1.21.4 and above.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Which version of Worlds should I choose?"
    id="version"
  >
    <Callout title="Important">
      You will only get support for the latest version of Worlds.   
      If you encounter any issues while running an older build, you will not receive any support.
    </Callout>
    
    If you are **not** running the **latest** version of Paper, visit [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/Worlds/versions)
    and look for the latest version supporting your server version.   
    For even older server versions, see the list below.
    
    [Latest version supporting 1.20.6 (Java 21)](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/Worlds/versions/1.2.5)   
    [Latest version supporting 1.19/1.20.4 (Java 19)](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/Worlds/versions/1.1.6)   
    [Latest version supporting 1.19/1.20.4 (Java 17)](https://hangar.papermc.io/TheNextLvl/Worlds/versions/1.1.3)

  <Accordion 
    title="I want to update from v1 to v2, what do I have to consider?"
    id="upgrade-v2"
  >
    Worlds v2 changed how worlds and links are loaded.
    When upgrading you have to import your worlds using the command
    
    `/world import <world> [<key>] [<dimension>] [<generator>]`
