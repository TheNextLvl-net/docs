  <Accordion
    title="I want to use Worlds and PerWorlds but my server doesn't start"
    id="perworlds"
  >
    **Worlds** already **bundles PerWorlds**.   
    You can safely **remove** the **PerWorlds jar** file from your plugins directory.   
    Paper will prevent the server startup if the **same plugin** is installed **twice**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion 
    title="Error on startup: ClassNotFoundException, NoSuchFieldError, InvocationTargetException, NullPointerException"
    id="error"
  >
    If you receive one of these errors on startup, it most likely means that your **server** version is **outdated**.   
    If you are running [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), make sure to use the most up to date branch.   
    If you are running Paper, make sure to use the latest build from their [website](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).

      If updating doesn't fix your problem, please [look for similar issues](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/Worlds/issues?q=is%3Aissue) 
      on our GitHub or [open one](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/worlds/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) if you can't find anything helpful

  <Accordion 
    title="Links don't work"
    id="links"
  >
    World **Links** only **restore** vanilla behavior for **portal travel** between 2 or 3 dimensions.   
    Links can only link one **overworld** to one **nether** and/or one **end** dimension.   
    _This feature is not intended to be used for custom portals._
