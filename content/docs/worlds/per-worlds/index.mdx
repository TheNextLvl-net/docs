## What is PerWorlds? [!toc]

PerWorlds is a plugin that allows you to group multiple worlds together, each with its own unique settings and configurations.
This also allows you to have **player data**, **inventories**, **gamerules**, and other settings that are specific to **each** world **group**.

<Callout type="info" title="Also standalone!">

PerWorlds is bundled with the Worlds plugin, providing a seamless experience for managing your worlds.  
If you don't want to use Worlds, you can still use [PerWorlds](https://modrinth.com/project/lpfQmSV2) as a standalone plugin.

  PerWorlds does not support Folia at the moment, there are still too many technical limitations.
