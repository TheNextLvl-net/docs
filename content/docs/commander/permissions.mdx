# Overriding/Querying Permissions

Command permission management allows you to override the default permissions of commands, set new permissions on commands that originally had none, and query current permission settings.

## Commands

### Set Command Permission
```
/command permission set <command> <permission>
```
Sets or overrides the permission required to execute a command. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to modify (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.
- `<permission>`: The permission node to require

**Examples:**
```
# Set permission on specific commands
/command permission set luckperms luckperms.use
/command permission set fly essentials.fly
/command permission set gamemode server.admin.gamemode

# Set permission on all commands
/command permission set * server.admin.all

# Set permission on all bukkit namespaced commands
/command permission set bukkit:* server.admin.bukkit

# Set permission on all namespaced commands
/command permission set *:* plugin.commands
```

### Query Command Permission
```
/command permission query <command>
```
Displays the current permission setting for a command. Supports wildcards for bulk queries.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to query (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Query specific commands
/command permission query luckperms
/command permission query fly

# Query all commands
/command permission query *

# Query all bukkit namespaced commands
/command permission query bukkit:*

# Query all namespaced commands
/command permission query *:*
```

### Reset Command Permission
```
/command permission reset <command>
```
Removes any permission override and restores the command's original permission. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to reset (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Reset specific commands
/command permission reset luckperms
/command permission reset fly

# Reset all permission overrides
/command permission reset *

# Reset all bukkit namespaced commands
/command permission reset bukkit:*

# Reset all namespaced commands
/command permission reset *:*
```

**Example:**
```
/command permission reset luckperms
/command permission reset fly
```

### Unset Command Permission
```
/command permission unset <command>
```
Removes the permission requirement from a command, making it usable by everyone. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.



**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to unset permission for (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Unset permission on specific commands
/command permission unset help
/command permission unset rules

# Unset permissions on all commands
/command permission unset *

# Unset permissions on all bukkit namespaced commands
/command permission unset bukkit:*

# Unset permissions on all namespaced commands
/command permission unset *:*
```

## Wildcard Support

Commander supports powerful wildcard patterns for bulk permission operations:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any command name
- `:*` - Matches any namespaced command (commands with colons)
- `prefix:*` - Matches all commands with a specific namespace prefix
- `*suffix` - Matches all commands ending with a specific suffix

### Common Wildcard Examples

```
# Set permission on ALL commands
/command permission set * server.admin.all

# Set permission on all vanilla Minecraft commands
/command permission set minecraft:* vanilla.commands

# Set permission on all Bukkit/Spigot commands
/command permission set bukkit:* bukkit.commands

# Set permission on all plugin commands (namespaced)
/command permission set *:* plugin.commands

# Set permission on all commands starting with "admin"
/command permission set admin* admin.commands

# Set permission on all commands ending with "list"
/command permission set *list utility.commands
```

### Wildcard Use Cases

#### Complete Permission Lockdown
```
# Require admin permission for ALL commands
/command permission set * server.admin.all

# Then make essential commands available to everyone
/command permission unset help
/command permission unset spawn
/command permission unset rules
```

#### Plugin Permission Standardization
```
# Set consistent permissions for all plugin commands
/command permission set *:* plugin.commands

# Override specific plugins with custom permissions
/command permission set luckperms:* luckperms.admin
/command permission set essentials:* essentials.admin
```

#### Server Type Configuration
```
# On a creative server, set creative-specific permissions
/command permission set fly creative.fly
/command permission set gamemode creative.gamemode
/command permission set worldedit:* creative.worldedit
```

#### Bulk Permission Management
```
# Remove all permission overrides
/command permission reset *

# Query all current permission overrides
/command permission query *

# Unset all permissions (make everything public)
/command permission unset *
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

üö® **CAUTION:** Using `/command permission set *` will affect **ALL** commands on the server, including essential ones.

üö® **PERMISSION IMPACT:** Wildcard permission changes can lock players out of essential commands. Always have a backup plan.

üí° **BEST PRACTICE:** Test wildcard operations on a development server first.

üí° **SELECTIVE APPROACH:** Use specific wildcards (like `prefix:*`) instead of `*` when possible for more control.

## Permissions

- `commander.admin` - Required to use all permission management commands

## Behavior

### Permission Override
- Overrides the original permission of a command
- The new permission is enforced by Commander
- Original plugin behavior is preserved
- Configuration is saved to a JSON file

### Permission Query
- Shows the current effective permission for a command
- Displays whether it's using the original permission or an override
- Useful for debugging permission issues

### Permission Reset
- Removes Commander's permission override
- Restores the command's original permission from its plugin
- If the command had no original permission, it becomes unrestricted

### Permission Unset
- Completely removes permission requirements
- Makes the command executable by anyone
- Useful for utility commands that should be universally available

## Use Cases

### Adding Permissions to Unrestricted Commands
Many plugins provide commands without permission requirements. Add security:

```
# Add permission to LuckPerms commands
/command permission set luckperms luckperms.admin
/command permission set perms luckperms.admin

# Add permission to economy commands
/command permission set eco economy.admin
/command permission set balance economy.user
```

### Restricting Powerful Commands
Add additional security layers:

```
# Make gamemode command require admin permission
/command permission set gamemode server.admin.gamemode

# Make world management commands require specific permissions
/command permission set world server.admin.world
/command permission set mv server.admin.multiverse
```

### World/Server-Specific Permissions
Use permission plugins to grant command access only in certain contexts:

```
# Set a permission that's only granted in creative world
/command permission set fly creative.fly

# Set a permission that's only granted on specific servers
/command permission set tp hub.teleport
```

### Debugging Permission Issues
Check what permissions are actually being enforced:

```
/command permission query fly
/command permission query gamemode
/command permission query home
```

## Configuration

Permission overrides are stored in a JSON configuration file. The file maps command names to their permission overrides.

```json
{
  "luckperms": "luckperms.admin",
  "fly": "essentials.fly",
  "gamemode": "server.admin.gamemode",
  "eco": "economy.admin"
}
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Be careful when unsetting permissions from commands that should be restricted.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Some plugins may not work correctly if their permission system is bypassed.

üí° **Tip:** Use descriptive permission names that follow your server's permission scheme.

üí° **Tip:** Combine with permission plugins to create world-specific or group-specific command access.

## Tips

- Commands are referenced without the `/` prefix in the configuration
- Use `/command reload` to reload the configuration if manually edited
- Use `/command save` to ensure changes are persisted to disk
- Query permissions before making changes to understand the current state
- Use permission plugins to grant the new permissions to specific users, groups, or worlds

## Examples

### Basic Security Setup
```
# Add permissions to commonly unrestricted commands
/command permission set plugins server.admin.plugins
/command permission set version server.admin.version
/command permission set reload server.admin.reload

# Make utility commands available to all players
/command permission unset help
/command permission unset rules
/command permission unset spawn
```

### Creative World Commands
```
# Set creative-specific permissions
/command permission set fly creative.fly
/command permission set gamemode creative.gamemode
/command permission set worldedit creative.worldedit
```

### Admin Tools
```
# Restrict powerful admin commands
/command permission set op server.admin.op
/command permission set whitelist server.admin.whitelist
/command permission set ban server.admin.ban
```
