# Hiding and Revealing Commands

Hiding commands allows you to control which commands appear in tab completion,
creating a cleaner experience for players while still allowing the commands to be executed by those who know them.

## Commands

### Hide a Command

Usage: `/command hide <command>`  
Hides a command from tab completion.

**Examples:**
```
<gray># Hide specific commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>pl</aqua>

<gray># Hide all commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all bukkit namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Using `/command hide "*"` will hide literally **ALL** commands, including `/command` itself.  
  Use `/command reveal "*"` to quickly restore all hidden commands.
</Callout>

### Reveal a Command
Usage: `/command reveal <command>`
Makes a previously hidden command visible again in tab completions.

**Examples:**
```
<gray># Reveal specific commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command reveal <aqua>pl</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all hidden commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all bukkit namespaced commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all namespaced commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>
```

## Bypass Permission
Players with the `commander.bypass` permission can see all hidden commands.

<Callout type="info">
  Wildcard permissions (like `*`) are ignored for the bypass permission.  
  Players must have the explicit `commander.bypass` permission to see hidden commands.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

### Clean Command Lists
Hide administrative or utility commands that regular players shouldn't see:
```
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>pl</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>version</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>ver</aqua>
```

### Server-Specific Commands
Hide commands that are only relevant to certain server types or gamemodes.

### Development Commands
Hide debugging or development commands from production environments.

## Configuration

Hidden commands are stored in a JSON configuration file.  
The file contains a simple array of command names that should be hidden.

`hidden-commands.json`:
```json
[
  "plugins",
  "pl",
  "version",
  "ver"
]
```

## Tips

- Commands are hidden without the `/` prefix in the configuration
- Both the full command name and aliases should be hidden if desired
- Use `/command reload` to reload the configuration if manually edited
