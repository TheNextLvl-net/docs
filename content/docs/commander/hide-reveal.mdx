# Hiding and Revealing Commands

Hiding commands allows you to control which commands appear in tab completion,
creating a cleaner experience for players while still allowing the commands to be executed by those who know them.

## Commands

### Hide a Command

Usage: `/command hide <command>`  
Hides a command from tab completion.
Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Examples:**
```
<gray># Hide specific commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>pl</aqua>

<gray># Hide all commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all bukkit namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>
```

### Reveal a Command
Usage: `/command reveal <command>`
Makes a previously hidden command visible again in tab completions.
Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Examples:**
```
<gray># Reveal specific commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command reveal <aqua>pl</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all hidden commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all bukkit namespaced commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>

<gray># Reveal all namespaced commands</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>
```

## Wildcard Support

Commander supports powerful wildcard patterns for bulk command operations:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any command name
- `*:*` - Matches any namespaced command (commands with colons)
- `prefix:*` - Matches all commands with a specific namespace prefix
- `*suffix` - Matches all commands ending with a specific suffix


<Callout type="warning">
  Using `/command hide "*"` will hide literally **ALL** commands, including `/command` itself.  
  Use `/command reveal "*"` to quickly restore all hidden commands.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Wildcard operations affect many commands at once.  
  Test carefully and consider using `/command save` before bulk operations.
</Callout>

### Common Wildcard Examples

```
<gray># Hide ALL commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all vanilla Minecraft commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"minecraft:*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all Bukkit/Spigot/Paper commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>"spigot:*"</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>"paper:*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all commands starting with "admin"</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"admin*"</aqua>

<gray># Hide all commands ending with "list"</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*list"</aqua>
```

### Wildcard Use Cases

#### Complete Command Cleanup
```
<gray># Hide all namespaced commands</gray>
/command hide <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>

<gray># Then selectively reveal essential ones</gray>
/command reveal <aqua>"essentials:*"</aqua>
/command reveal <aqua>"luckperms:*"</aqua>
```

## Behavior

### Hidden Commands

- Hidden commands are **still executable** by players who know the command
- Hidden commands don't appear in tab completion
- Hidden commands **still appear** in help menus (`/help`, `/?`)

### Bypass Permission
Players with the `commander.bypass` permission can see all hidden commands.

<Callout type="info">
  Wildcard permissions (like `*`) are ignored for the bypass permission.  
  Players must have the explicit `commander.bypass` permission to see hidden commands.
</Callout>

## Use Cases

### Clean Command Lists
Hide administrative or utility commands that regular players shouldn't see:
```
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>pl</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>version</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>ver</aqua>
```

### Server-Specific Commands
Hide commands that are only relevant to certain server types or gamemodes.

### Development Commands
Hide debugging or development commands from production environments.

## Configuration

Hidden commands are stored in a JSON configuration file.  
The file contains a simple array of command names that should be hidden.

`hidden-commands.json`:
```json
[
  "plugins",
  "pl",
  "version",
  "ver"
]
```

## Tips

- Commands are hidden without the `/` prefix in the configuration
- Both the full command name and aliases should be hidden if desired
- Use `/command reload` to reload the configuration if manually edited
