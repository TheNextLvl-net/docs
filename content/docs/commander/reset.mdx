# Resetting Commands

The reset command allows you to completely restore a command to its original state,
removing all Commander modifications including hiding, unregistering, and permission overrides.

## Command

### Reset a Command

Usage: `/command reset <command>`  
Completely resets a command to its original state, removing all modifications made by Commander.

**Examples:**
```
<gray># Reset specific commands</gray>
/command reset <aqua>luckperms</aqua>
/command reset <aqua>fly</aqua>
/command reset <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command reset <aqua>op</aqua>

<gray># Reset ALL commands (restore everything to original state)</gray>
/command reset <aqua>"*"</aqua>

<gray># Reset all bukkit namespaced commands</gray>
/command reset <aqua>"bukkit:*"</aqua>

<gray># Reset all namespaced commands</gray>
/command reset <aqua>"*:*"</aqua>
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Resetting a command will remove ALL Commander modifications.  
  If you only want to remove specific modifications, use the appropriate command instead:
  - Use `/command reveal` to only unhide a command
  - Use `/command register` to only restore an unregistered command
  - Use `/command permission reset` to only remove a permission override
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Resetting commands that were unregistered for security reasons may expose them to all players again.
</Callout>

## Configuration Changes

When you reset a command, Commander will:

1. Remove the command from all configuration files
2. Update the hidden commands list
3. Update the unregistered commands list
4. Update the permission overrides list
5. Apply the changes immediately

## Tips

- Use reset when you want to completely start over with a command
- Consider the security implications of resetting unregistered commands
- Test the command after resetting to ensure it works as expected
