# Resetting Commands

The reset command allows you to completely restore a command to its original state, removing all Commander modifications including hiding, unregistering, and permission overrides.

## Command

### Reset a Command
```
/command reset <command>
```
Completely resets a command to its original state, removing all modifications made by Commander. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to reset (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Reset specific commands
/command reset luckperms
/command reset fly
/command reset plugins
/command reset op

# Reset ALL commands (restore everything to original state)
/command reset *

# Reset all bukkit namespaced commands
/command reset bukkit:*

# Reset all namespaced commands
/command reset *:*
```

## Permissions

- `commander.admin` - Required to use the reset command

## Wildcard Support

Commander supports powerful wildcard patterns for bulk reset operations:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any command name
- `:*` - Matches any namespaced command (commands with colons)
- `prefix:*` - Matches all commands with a specific namespace prefix
- `*suffix` - Matches all commands ending with a specific suffix

### Common Wildcard Examples

```
# Reset ALL commands (complete restore)
/command reset *

# Reset all vanilla Minecraft commands
/command reset minecraft:*

# Reset all Bukkit/Spigot commands
/command reset bukkit:*

# Reset all plugin commands (namespaced)
/command reset *:*

# Reset all commands starting with "admin"
/command reset admin*

# Reset all commands ending with "list"
/command reset *list
```

### Wildcard Use Cases

#### Complete Server Reset
```
# Reset everything to original state
/command reset *
```

#### Plugin-Specific Reset
```
# Reset all commands from a specific plugin
/command reset worldedit:*
/command reset essentials:*
/command reset luckperms:*
```

#### Category Reset
```
# Reset all administrative commands
/command reset admin*
/command reset *admin

# Reset all utility commands
/command reset *list
/command reset *info
```

#### Namespace Management
```
# Reset all namespaced commands (usually plugin commands)
/command reset *:*

# Keep only vanilla commands modified
/command reset bukkit:*
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

üö® **COMPLETE RESET:** Using `/command reset *` will remove **ALL** Commander modifications from **ALL** commands on the server.

üö® **SECURITY IMPACT:** Resetting commands that were unregistered for security reasons will make them available again.

üö® **PERMISSION CHANGES:** Resetting will restore original permissions, which may be less restrictive than your current setup.

üí° **BACKUP FIRST:** Consider using `/command save` before bulk reset operations to create a backup.

üí° **SELECTIVE RESET:** Use specific wildcards (like `prefix:*`) instead of `*` when possible for more control.

## Behavior

### What Reset Does

When you reset a command, Commander will:

1. **Remove Hiding**: If the command was hidden, it becomes visible again
2. **Restore Registration**: If the command was unregistered, it becomes available again
3. **Remove Permission Override**: If a custom permission was set, the original permission is restored
4. **Clear All Overrides**: Any and all Commander modifications are removed

### What Reset Affects

- **Hidden Commands**: Makes them visible in tab completion and help menus
- **Unregistered Commands**: Makes them executable again by all players
- **Permission Overrides**: Restores the original plugin permission or removes permission requirements
- **All States**: Works regardless of the command's current state

## Use Cases

### Complete Command Restoration
Reset a command that has multiple modifications:

```
# Suppose luckperms was hidden, had a permission override, and was unregistered
/command reset luckperms
# Now luckperms is completely back to its original state
```

### Troubleshooting
Reset commands that are behaving unexpectedly:

```
# If a command isn't working as expected after multiple changes
/command reset fly
/command reset gamemode
```

### Starting Over
Clear all modifications to start fresh:

```
# Remove all Commander changes from a command
/command reset plugins
/command reset version
```

### Plugin Updates
Reset commands after plugin updates to ensure compatibility:

```
# After updating a plugin, reset its commands
/command reset essentials
/command reset eco
```

## Examples

### Single Command Reset
```
/command reset fly
```
This will:
- Show `fly` in tab completion if it was hidden
- Make `fly` executable if it was unregistered
- Restore the original permission if it was overridden

### Multiple Command Resets
```
/command reset luckperms
/command reset perms
/command reset lp
```
Reset all LuckPerms-related commands to their original state.

### Administrative Commands
```
/command reset op
/command reset deop
/command reset stop
```
Restore critical administrative commands to their default behavior.

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Resetting a command will remove ALL Commander modifications. If you only want to remove specific modifications, use the appropriate command instead:
- Use `/command reveal` to only unhide a command
- Use `/command register` to only restore an unregistered command
- Use `/command permission reset` to only remove a permission override

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Resetting commands that were unregistered for security reasons may expose them to all players again.

üí° **Tip:** Use `/command permission query` before resetting to see what modifications are currently applied to a command.

## Configuration Changes

When you reset a command, Commander will:

1. Remove the command from all configuration files
2. Update the hidden commands list
3. Update the unregistered commands list
4. Update the permission overrides list
5. Apply the changes immediately

## Verification

After resetting a command, you can verify its state:

```
# Check if the command is visible and working
/fly

# Check the permission (if any)
/command permission query fly

# Try tab completion to see if it appears
/fly<TAB>
```

## Tips

- Use reset when you want to completely start over with a command
- Consider the security implications of resetting unregistered commands
- Use `/command save` after resetting to ensure configuration is persisted
- Test the command after resetting to ensure it works as expected
- Keep track of which commands you reset for documentation purposes

## Common Scenarios

### Accidental Modifications
```
# Oops! I accidentally hid the plugins command and set a wrong permission
/command reset plugins
# Now plugins is back to normal
```

### Testing Cleanup
```
# After testing various command modifications
/command reset testcommand
/command reset experimental
# Clean slate for next test
```

### Security Review
```
# Review and reset commands that were over-secured
/command reset help
/command reset spawn
# Make essential commands available again
```
