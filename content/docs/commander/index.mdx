# Commander

Commander is a powerful Minecraft server plugin that gives you complete control over command visibility,
permissions, and registration.
Clean up your command list, enhance security, and customize your server's command experience.

## Features

### Command Management

- **Hide Commands**: Control which commands appear in tab completion
- **Unregister Commands**: Completely remove commands from the server

### Permission Control

- **Override Permissions**: Set custom permissions on any command
- **Query Permissions**: Check current permission settings
- **Add Security**: Restrict commands that originally had no permissions

### Configuration

- **JSON Configuration**: Simple, human-readable configuration files
- **Hot Reload**: Apply changes without server restart
- **Manual Editing**: Direct configuration file access

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

The main command of Commander is `/command` (or `/commandv` on the proxy),  
and requires the permission `commander.admin`:

```
<gray># Hide commands from players</gray>
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>pl</aqua>

<gray># Add permissions to unrestricted commands</gray>
/command permission set <aqua>luckperms</aqua> <yellow>luckperms.use</yellow>

<gray># Remove dangerous commands entirely</gray>
/command unregister <aqua>op</aqua>
/command unregister <aqua>deop</aqua>

<gray># Save your changes (not required)</gray>
/command save
```

### Common Scenarios

#### Clean Command List

Hide administrative commands from regular players:
```
/command hide <aqua>plugins</aqua>
/command hide <aqua>version</aqua>
```

#### Security Hardening

Remove dangerous commands:
```
/command unregister <aqua>op</aqua>
/command unregister <aqua>deop</aqua>
```

#### Plugin Integration

Add permissions to plugin commands that lack them:
```
/command permission set <aqua>luckperms</aqua> <yellow>luckperms.use</yellow>
/command permission set <aqua>eco</aqua> <yellow>economy.admin</yellow>
```

## Permission System

### Required Permissions

- `commander.admin` - Access to all Commander commands
- `commander.bypass` - See hidden commands (wildcard permissions ignored)

### Permission Override

Commander can override permissions on (almost) any command, even those from other plugins.  
This allows you to:
- Add permissions to unrestricted commands
- Change existing permissions
- Create world-specific or group-specific command access

## Wildcard Support

Commander supports powerful wildcard patterns for bulk operations on commands:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any command name
- `*:*` - Matches any namespaced command (commands with colons)
- `prefix:*` - Matches all commands with a specific namespace prefix
- `*suffix` - Matches all commands ending with a specific suffix

<Callout type="warning">
  Wildcard operations affect many commands at once.  
  Test carefully and consider using `/command save` before bulk operations.  
  _To restore from a saved configuration, use `/command reload`._
</Callout>

## Configuration Files

Commander stores settings in three JSON files:

- **`hidden-commands.json`** - List of hidden commands
- **`unregistered-commands.json`** - List of unregistered commands
- **`permission-overrides.json`** - Command permission overrides

## Use Cases

- Clean up command clutter for players
- Remove dangerous commands like `/op` and `/deop`
- Add security layers to plugin commands
- Create context-specific command access
