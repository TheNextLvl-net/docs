# Reloading/Saving Configs

Configuration management allows you to reload Commander settings from disk and manually save changes to ensure persistence.

## Commands

### Reload Configuration
```
/command reload
```
Reload all Commander configuration files from disk, applying any changes made manually to the configuration files.

### Save Configuration
```
/command save
```
Manually saves all current Commander settings to the configuration files, ensuring all changes are persisted.

## Permissions

- `commander.admin` - Required to use both reload and save commands

## Configuration Files

Commander uses three separate JSON configuration files to store different types of command modifications:

### Hidden Commands (`hidden.json`)
Stores commands that are hidden from tab completion and help menus.

```json
[
  "plugins",
  "pl",
  "version",
  "ver"
]
```

### Unregistered Commands (`unregistered.json`)
Stores commands that are completely removed from the server.

```json
[
  "op",
  "deop",
  "stop",
  "reload"
]
```

### Permission Overrides (`permissions.json`)
Stores custom permission settings for commands.

```json
{
  "luckperms": "luckperms.admin",
  "fly": "essentials.fly",
  "gamemode": "server.admin.gamemode"
}
```

## Behavior

### Reload Command
- Reads all three configuration files from disk
- Applies any changes made to the files
- Updates the in-memory state of Commander
- Overwrites any unsaved changes in memory

### Save Command
- Writes the current in-memory state to all configuration files
- Ensures all recent changes are persisted
- Creates backup files if they don't exist
- Validates JSON syntax before writing

## Use Cases

### Manual Configuration Editing
Edit configuration files directly and reload changes:

```
# Edit hidden.json manually to add/remove hidden commands
# Then apply the changes
/command reload
```

### Backup and Restore
Save current state before making changes:

```
# Save current configuration
/command save

# Make changes...

# If something goes wrong, restore from backup and reload
/command reload
```

### Multiple Administrators
Ensure changes are synchronized between multiple administrators:

```
# After another admin makes changes
/command reload

# After making your own changes
/command save
```

### Server Maintenance
Save configuration before server restarts:

```
# Ensure all changes are saved before restart
/command save
# Then restart the server
```

### Troubleshooting
Reload configuration to fix issues:

```
# If commands aren't behaving as expected
/command reload
```

## Manual Configuration

### Editing Hidden Commands
Edit `plugins/Commander/hidden.json`:

```json
[
  "plugins",
  "pl",
  "version",
  "ver",
  "about",
  "bukkit:version"
]
```

### Editing Unregistered Commands
Edit `plugins/Commander/unregistered.json`:

```json
[
  "op",
  "deop",
  "stop",
  "reload",
  "bukkit:reload"
]
```

### Editing Permission Overrides
Edit `plugins/Commander/permissions.json`:

```json
{
  "luckperms": "luckperms.admin",
  "fly": "essentials.fly",
  "gamemode": "server.admin.gamemode",
  "eco": "economy.admin"
}
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Manual editing requires proper JSON syntax. Invalid JSON will cause reload to fail.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Reloading will overwrite any unsaved changes in memory.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Configuration files are case-sensitive. Use exact command names.

üí° **Tip:** Always save before making manual changes to create a backup.

üí° **Tip:** Use a JSON validator when editing configuration files manually.

üí° **Tip:** Commands in configuration files should not include the `/` prefix.

## Best Practices

### Regular Saves
```
# Save after making any changes
/command hide plugins
/command save

/command permission set fly essentials.fly
/command save
```

### Before Manual Editing
```
# Save current state first
/command save

# Then edit files manually
# Finally, reload changes
/command reload
```

### After Manual Editing
```
# Always reload after manual edits
/command reload

# Verify changes took effect
/command permission query fly
```

### Troubleshooting Steps
```
# If commands aren't working correctly
/command save    # Save current state
/command reload  # Reload from disk
```

## File Locations

Configuration files are typically located at:
```
plugins/Commander/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hidden.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unregistered.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ permissions.json
```

The exact location may vary depending on your server setup.

## Error Handling

### Invalid JSON
If a configuration file contains invalid JSON:
- Reload will fail with an error message
- Current settings will remain unchanged
- Fix the JSON syntax and try again

### Missing Files
If configuration files are missing:
- Commander will create new empty files
- Default settings will be used
- Save will create the files with current settings

### Permission Issues
If Commander can't write to configuration files:
- Save will fail with an error message
- Check file permissions and disk space
- Ensure the plugins directory is writable

## Tips

- Use `/command save` frequently to avoid losing changes
- Reload after manual edits to apply changes
- Keep backups of configuration files
- Test changes in a development environment first
- Use JSON linters/validators when editing manually
- Document your configuration changes for future reference
