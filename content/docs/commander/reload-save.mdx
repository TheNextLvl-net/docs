# Reloading/Saving Configs

Configuration management allows you to reload Commander settings from disk and manually save changes to ensure persistence.

<Callout type="tip">
  Manual editing requires proper JSON syntax.  
  Use a JSON validator when editing configuration files manually.
</Callout>

## Commands

### Reload Configuration

Usage: `/command reload`  
Reload all Commander configuration files from disk, applying any changes made manually to the configuration files.

<Callout type="warning">
  Reloading will overwrite any unsaved changes in memory.
</Callout>

### Save Configuration

Usage: `/command save`  
Manually saves all current Commander settings to the configuration files, ensuring all changes are persisted.

## Configuration Files

Commander uses three separate JSON configuration files to store different types of command modifications:

<Callout type="warning">
  Configuration files are case-sensitive. Use exact command names.
</Callout>

### Hidden Commands

Stores commands that are hidden from tab completions.

`hidden-commands.json`:
```json
[
  "plugins",
  "pl",
  "version",
  "ver"
]
```

### Unregistered Commands

Stores commands that are completely removed from the server.

`unregistered-commands.json`:
```json
[
  "op",
  "deop",
  "stop",
  "reload"
]
```

### Permission Overrides

Stores custom permission settings for commands.

`permission-overrides.json`:
```json
{
  "luckperms": "luckperms.admin",
  "fly": "essentials.fly",
  "gamemode": "server.admin.gamemode"
}
```

## Tips

- Reload after manual edits to apply changes
- Test changes in a development environment first
- Use JSON linters/validators when editing manually
