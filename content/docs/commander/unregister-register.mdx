# Un-/registering Commands

Command registration allows you to completely remove commands from the server or restore previously removed commands. Unlike hiding, unregistered commands cannot be executed by anyone.

## Commands

### Unregister a Command
```
/command unregister <command>
```
Completely removes a command from the server. The command becomes unusable by all players. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to unregister (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Unregister specific commands
/command unregister op
/command unregister deop
/command unregister stop

# Unregister all commands (use with extreme caution!)
/command unregister *

# Unregister all bukkit namespaced commands
/command unregister bukkit:*

# Unregister all namespaced commands
/command unregister *:*
```

### Register a Command
```
/command register <command>
```
Restores a previously unregistered command, making it available again. Supports wildcards for bulk operations.

**Parameters:**
- `<command>`: The command to register (without the `/` prefix). Supports wildcards.

**Examples:**
```
# Register specific commands
/command register op
/command register deop

# Register all unregistered commands
/command register *

# Register all bukkit namespaced commands
/command register bukkit:*

# Register all namespaced commands
/command register *:*
```

## Permissions

- `commander.admin` - Required to use both unregister and register commands

## Behavior

### Unregistered Commands
- Unregistered commands are **completely removed** from the server
- Unregistered commands cannot be executed by anyone, including administrators
- Unregistered commands don't appear in tab completion or help menus
- The command configuration is saved to a JSON file

### Registered Commands
- Previously unregistered commands become fully functional again
- All original permissions and behavior are restored
- The command appears in tab completion and help menus (unless hidden)

## Wildcard Support

Commander supports powerful wildcard patterns for bulk command operations:

### Wildcard Patterns

- `*` - Matches any command name
- `:*` - Matches any namespaced command (commands with colons)
- `prefix:*` - Matches all commands with a specific namespace prefix
- `*suffix` - Matches all commands ending with a specific suffix

### Common Wildcard Examples

```
# Unregister ALL commands (extremely dangerous!)
/command unregister *

# Unregister all vanilla Minecraft commands
/command unregister minecraft:*

# Unregister all Bukkit/Spigot commands
/command unregister bukkit:*

# Unregister all plugin commands (namespaced)
/command unregister *:*

# Unregister all commands starting with "admin"
/command unregister admin*

# Unregister all commands ending with "list"
/command unregister *list
```

### Wildcard Use Cases

#### Complete Plugin Removal
```
# Remove all commands from a specific plugin
/command unregister worldedit:*
/command unregister essentials:*
```

#### Server Type Configuration
```
# On a survival server, remove all creative commands
/command unregister fly
/command unregister gamemode
/command unregister worldedit:*
```

#### Security Lockdown
```
# Remove all administrative commands
/command unregister admin*
/command unregister *admin
/command unregister op
/command unregister deop
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings

üö® **EXTREME CAUTION:** Using `/command unregister *` will remove **ALL** commands from the server, including `/command` itself. This may require server restart or config file editing to recover.

üö® **DANGEROUS:** Wildcard unregister operations are irreversible through normal commands. You'll need to edit configuration files manually or use `/command register *` to restore.

üö® **PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY:** Unregistering all commands from a plugin may cause the plugin to malfunction or crash.

## Use Cases

### Security Hardening
Remove dangerous commands that should never be used:
```
/command unregister op
/command unregister deop
/command unregister stop
/command unregister reload

# Remove all administrative commands at once
/command unregister admin*
```

### Plugin Management
Remove commands from plugins you don't want players to use:
```
/command unregister essentials
/command unregister eco
```

### Temporary Disabling
Unregister commands temporarily during events or maintenance:
```
/command unregister tp
/command unregister home
```

### Server-Specific Commands
Unregister commands that don't apply to your server type:
```
# On a survival server, unregister creative commands
/command unregister gamemode
/command unregister fly
```

## Configuration

Unregistered commands are stored in a JSON configuration file. The file contains a simple array of command names that should be unregistered.

```json
[
  "op",
  "deop",
  "stop",
  "reload"
]
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Be careful when unregistering essential commands. Some unregistered commands may require a server restart to be properly restored.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Unregistering commands from other plugins may cause those plugins to malfunction. Always test in a development environment first.

## Tips

- Commands are unregistered without the `/` prefix in the configuration
- Both the main command and aliases should be unregistered if desired
- Use `/command reload` to reload the configuration if manually edited
- Use `/command save` to ensure changes are persisted to disk
- Consider using command hiding instead of unregistering if you still want administrators to use the command

## Difference from Hiding

| Feature | Hide | Unregister |
|---------|------|------------|
| Command execution | Still possible | Completely blocked |
| Who can use | Anyone who knows it | Nobody |
| Administrator access | Yes (with bypass) | No |
| Use case | Clean UI | Security/Disabling |
