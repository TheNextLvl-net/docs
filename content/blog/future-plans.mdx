# What are we currently working on?

## Portals

As some of you may already know, we started working on a new plugin called [Portals](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/portals).  
The API already works but commands and actual functionality is yet to come.  
Beta builds will probably arrive within the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned.

## Holograms

_Previously known as HologramAPI_

HologramAPI got a huge rebranding and is now called [Holograms](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/holograms).  
Instead of just an API developers could use to create holograms,
it is now going to be a proper plugin, everyone can use and enjoy.

There already is an alpha build out, but only to supersede the discontinued HologramAPI.  
The plugin still lacks all commands and interaction points from within the game,
but hopefully we are able to ship the first usable release this year.

## PerWorlds

A long requested feature is currently in the making: **Data import from other plugins.**  
_(e.g. Multiverse-Inventories, MultiInv…)_

# Our future plans and ideas

## Broader version support

A big critique point we are often facing is about the game versions we support.  
To make development and support easier for ourselves we generally only support the most recent game version.  
But with Mojang dropping more and more updates in a shorter period of time, the amount of users we leave behind is growing with every new version.  
From a user standpoint I can see how you are not always able to be on the most recent version, especially because of plugins that still want to support Spigot.  

The idea now is to only support the last 3 most recent major versions of the game.  
(At the time of writing 1.21.10 is the latest version, meaning 1.21.8 and 1.21.6 would also still be supported)  

This comes with a few technical challenges and downsides, we might not be able to immediately support new features as they come out.  
But on the other hand when a feature finally gets introduced it will be better tested, developed and more stable.

## Backwards compatibility

This is a tough topic for many developers…  
Personally I always said that no backwards compatibility will ever be provided – BUT, I saw that a lot of users of our plugins are still on 1.21.4  
(especially with the plugin Worlds)

Due to that we are planning on **TEMPORARILY** bringing back compatibility for that specific version.  
This does not inherently mean you are always getting new features, **only bug fixes**.
