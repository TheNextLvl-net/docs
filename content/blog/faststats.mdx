You might have seen it in our changelogs recently: **"Integrated FastStats"**

> Now hold on, what is FastStats?

FastStats is a new and upcoming stats and metrics platform for developers,  
comparable to [bStats](https://bstats.org/), made by [@LuggaPugga](https://github.com/LuggaPugga) and me ([@NonSwag](https://nonswag.dev)).  
It allows us to gather data about plugin usage, and other relevant information to improve our plugins.

FastStats is currently in closed beta, field-testing has started.  
We are slowly integrating FastStats into our plugins.

Since we value your privacy, we want to officially inform you about it now, because not everyone reads our changelogs.

You may opt out of FastStats metrics collection at any time, by setting `enabled` to `false` in your `faststats/config.properties`.  
If you are a server administrator, we recommend reading more about FastStats [here](https://faststats.dev/info).

If you are a developer yourself and want to be part of the closed beta, [join the Discord](https://faststats.dev/discord)
and request an invitation code.
