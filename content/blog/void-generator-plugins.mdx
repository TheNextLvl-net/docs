# What is wrong with using a Void Generator Plugin?

I have often encountered the problem of corrupted worlds when using a Void Generator Plugin.  
In case the world is transferred between servers or loaded in single player where the generator plugin is not available,
Vanilla will pick up chunk generation where the generator cut off.  
This causes the typical world corruption look many people are familiar with, a giant void surrounded by land.

Another issue that bugs me is, most void generator plugins don't override the biome to be `minecraft:the_void`,
nor spawn a proper [start platform](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Void_Start_Platform),
or even set no spawn point, resulting you in plummeting to your death as soon as you enter the world.

> But I can just ensure the plugin is always available.

While that is a valid point, it is not always possible or practical.  
When sharing worlds with others, you might not always have control over the plugin availability.  
Also, imagine the plugin fails to load or gets disabled for some reason.  
Then you are left with a corrupted world and no simple way to fix it.

Furthermore, some Void Generator Plugins might not be compatible with all Minecraft servers or versions.

# The Solution?

Just use vanilla Minecraft! No plugins required, forward compatible, and works everywhere.

Vanilla offers so-called [Flat world presets](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Superflat#Default_presets).  
These presets allow you to create a world with a custom flat terrain.  
You might be most familiar with the Classic Flat preset.

The [Void](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_Void) preset has been around since Minecraft 1.9
_(specifically [15w37a](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_15w37a))_, so almost a decade.

It spawns a proper [start platform](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Void_Start_Platform),
making it easier to build on, and only consists of the `minecraft:the_void` biome,
resulting in a less frustrating experience when first entering the world.

## World management plugins

You are probably already using one, and most serious world management plugins support creating worlds with custom presets
_(also known as "generator settings")_.

Our plugin [Worlds](/docs/worlds), allows you to use presets without any hassle.
```
/world create <aqua>"My void world"</aqua> preset <yellow>the-void</yellow>
```

With plugins like [Multiverse-Core](https://modrinth.com/project/3wmN97b8) this might be a little more complicated, but still possible.
```
/mv create <aqua>my_void_world normal --generator-settings {"biome":"minecraft:the_void","layers":[]}</aqua>
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Multiverse-Core does not support custom generator settings on nether and end dimensions.  
  _Worlds does not have this limitation ;)_
</Callout>

## Vanilla Minecraft settings

If you don't have, or want to use, a world management plugin, you can use the generator settings directly inside the `server.properties` file.
```properties
generator-settings={"biome"\:"minecraft\:the_void","layers"\:[]}
level-type=minecraft\:flat
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The `generator-settings` approach only works for the overworld and only for new worlds.  
  Also make sure to escape your colons and to set `level-type` to `minecraft:flat` as well.
</Callout>

## Singleplayer

In Singleplayer, you can also select the Void preset from the world creation screen when creating a new Superflat world,
by clicking the "Customize" button, selecting "Presets", choosing "The Void" and then "Use Preset" and "Done".

You can also just upload singleplayer worlds to your server and every generator setting will be respected.
